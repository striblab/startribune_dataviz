traffic stop notes

27% of the drivers who were stopped were black. Blacks (non-Hispanic) make up 15% of the city’s population
36% of the drivers who were stopped were white. Whites (non-Hispanic) make up 53% of the city’s population
7% of the drivers were Hispanic. 9% of the city’s population is Hispanic
8% of the drivers were Asian. 18% of the city’s population is Asian
 
**note: these percentages are including the “unknowns” in the grand total that is used as the denominator. If we exclude the unknowns, the percentages shift to 34% black and 46% white (in other words…. Of the drivers where the race was identified, 34% were black, 46% were white). I’m assuming the police will include the unknowns in their calculations, but this is something we should ask them now, if possible. We would want to follow their lead on this so that it’s not confusing for readers
 
Combining in gender and race together shows….
23% of the drivers stopped were white males. (they make up 29% of the city’s population)
19% were black males (8% of city population)
13% were white females (30% of city population)
 
Overall, males made up 54% of those stopped. Women made up 29%  and 17% where gender is unknown
 
 
49% of the drivers who were searched were black; 32% were white; 10% were Hispanic; 7% Asian
 
48% of the drivers who were frisked were black; 33% were white; 11% Hispanic; 7% Asian
 

 ----------

 These three charts make me believe that the huge numbers of “unknowns” in more recent years are most likely white people. Notice how the black percentages hold pretty steady (same is true with other minorities, which I didn’t include here), but the white percentages shift dramatically in line with when the unknown percentages shift
 
Scary percentage of unknowns in 2015, too
