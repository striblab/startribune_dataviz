STRIPZONE

YES:

---In B4, B4S and B4C Districts

NO:

Places you can't have a strip club per ordinance:

E/SE of centerline of 5th Ave S
--Does this mean no strip clubs on the south side of the LRT line in Downtown?

1,000 feet of residence district
1,000 feed of office resident district
--Does this mean there's an additional 1,000-foot buffer along the border of a residence or office resident district and the Downtown B4 districts?


N/NW Centerline of Burlington Northern Railway right-of-way




---Nicollet Ave
--On the same block face as another strip club
--500 feet of religious institution
--500 feet of child care center built before 1986
--500 feet of K-12 public school
--500 feet of a public library


Lake St, Franklin Ave and Lyndale Ave have some of these C4 General Commercial Districts, which the ordinance says might be allowed to have "a rap parlour or sauna" -- does this extend to strip clubs or sex shops?




Smitten Kitten (adult entertainment store) and Venus Unvieled (lingerie store) are both off off W Lake St in Uptown are outside of the C4 zones.
