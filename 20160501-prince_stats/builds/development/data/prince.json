The bass-less minimalism of “When Doves Cry,” his most personal song to date, is as irresistibly entrancing as “Purple Rain” is spiritually transcendent, and “Baby, I’m a Star” is joyous.The movie: Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Kid. He's talented, sexy, cocksure and sure wears a lot of tight pants. Unfortunately, his arrogance as an artist, occasional rudeness to friends and mistrust of the music business threatens to sideline his career. Hmm, 20 years later, can we still call this fiction? Actually, \"Purple Rain\" stands up as a classic music movie in the realm of \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Jailhouse Rock.\" Sure, the acting is workable at best, and the story is sometimes laughable. But the musical performances are exceptional, and Prince's personality - good and bad - fills the screen.

In many ways, it’s the Lennon to “Purple Rain’s” McCartney.

Thank goodness for that. It helps that it is based on one of Prince's best albums, but he could be singing songs from the dreadful \"Come\" album, and chances are his on-stage charisma would shine on screen. This one might be more essential than \"Purple Rain\" in telling what the artist is all about.","strib_score":"","author":"Jon Bream and Chris Riemenschneider","art":"sign_o_the_times.jpg","url":"#"},{"year":1988,"date":"1988-01-01T06:00:00.000Z","track":18,"type":"billboard","notes":"#","AvgTicketsSold":"#","TicketsSold":"#","gross_millions":"#","rank":8,"label":"#","avg_price":"#","title":"Alphabet St.","strib_copy":"#","strib_score":"#","author":"#","art":"billboard.png","url":"#"},{"year":1988,"date":"1988-01-01T06:00:00.000Z","track":19,"type":"billboard","notes":"#","AvgTicketsSold":"#","TicketsSold":"#","gross_millions":"#","rank":10,"label":"#","avg_price":"#","title":"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man","strib_copy":"#","strib_score":"#","author":"#","art":"billboard.png","url":"#"},{"year":1988,"date":"1988-01-01T06:00:00.000Z","track":35,"type":"billboard","notes":"#","AvgTicketsSold":"#","TicketsSold":"#","gross_millions":"#","rank":63,"label":"#","avg_price":"#","title":"Hot Thing","strib_copy":"#","strib_score":"#","author":"#","art":"billboard.png","url":"#"},{"year":1988,"date":"1988-01-01T06:00:00.000Z","track":"#","type":"tickets","notes":"North America","AvgTicketsSold":16175,"TicketsSold":452914,"gross_millions":10.1,"rank":25,"label":"Creative Artists Agency","avg_price":22.3,"title":"North American Ticket Sales","strib_copy":"#","strib_score":"#","author":"#","art":"tickets.png","url":"#"},{"year":1988,"date":"1988-01-01T06:00:00.000Z","track":"#","type":"tour","notes":"#","AvgTicketsSold":16175,"TicketsSold":"#","gross_millions":10.1,"rank":25,"label":"#","avg_price":"#","title":"Lovesexy Tour","strib_copy":"#","strib_score":"#","author":"#","art":"tour.png","url":"#"},{"year":1988,"date":"1988-05-10T05:00:00.000Z","track":"#","type":"album","notes":"#","AvgTicketsSold":"#","TicketsSold":"#","gross_millions":"#","rank":"Platinum","label":"Paisley Park, Warner Bros.","avg_price":"#","title":"Lovesexy","strib_copy":"Lacking the grandiosity and swiftness of “Sign o’ the Times,” this CD was largely dismissed upon release - in part because of Prince’s nude cover pose - but has proven to be more pivotal.
