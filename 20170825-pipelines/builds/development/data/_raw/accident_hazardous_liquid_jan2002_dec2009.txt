THE CONTROLLER WAS CONCERNED WITH THE THE ""OVER/SHORT"" VOLUMES ON THE SYSTEM. THE LINE WAS FLOWN, BUT NO PRODUCT RELEASE WAS FOUND BY THE AERIAL SURVEILLANCE PILOT. THE PILOT ONLY OBSERVED WHAT HE TOUGHT WAS A SMALL RELEASE OF WATER FROM A RANCHER'S WATER SYSTEM. IT WASN'T UNTIL 01/07/02 @ 11:25AM THAT THE PRODUCT RELEASE WAS DISCOVERED AT 89 MILES NORTH OF EL PASO (TSP17S R1E BLOCK 9). THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN AT THAT POINT. AN INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED AND NOTIFICATIONS TO AGENCIES WERE MADE WITH PRELIMINARY RELEASE VOLUME ESTIMATES. THE FINAL VOLUMES WERE DETERMINED TO BE 250 BBLS OF DIESEL AND 700 BBLS OF UNLEADED GASOLINE. NO PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED IN THE CONVENTIONAL MEANS. RESIDUAL SOIL CONTAMINATION WILL BE CLEANED UP.    IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE RELEASE WAS A PIPE WELD FAILURE. THE WELD WAS MADE DURING THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION  IN 1954. THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM WAS NOT DETECTED IN THE LATEST IN-LINE TOOL INSPECTION, CONDUCTED ON THIS LINE IN 2000.    AGENCIES NOTIFIED: NRC CONTACTED 1/7/02 @ 2:00 PM (OFFICER TRUMAN - RPT # 590400).

THE PIPELINE LEAK SITE WAS CONFIRMED AT 6:14PM TO BE JUST OUTSIDE THE SALT LAKE REFINERY BOUNDARY FENCE NEAR HIGHWAY I-215 AT MILEPOST 0.28.  THE INITAL VOLUME REPORTED WAS 200 BARRELS OF DIESEL/GASOLINE MIX.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION ON FEBRUARY 7, REVEALED CORROSION DAMAGE TO THE PIPE FROM WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SECOND PATCH OF EXTERNAL PIPE COATING THAT WAS MADE OVER THE ORIGINAL COATING, AT POINT OF FAILURE.  ANOTHER PIPELINE, NOT BELONGING TO CPL, CROSSED BELOW OUR PIPELINE AT THE POINT WHERE THE COATING PATCH WAS FOUND. THE FAILURE OCCURRED ABOUT 9 FEET FROM AN UPSTREAM WELD, RESULTING IN AN APPRX 14 TO 15 INCH RUPTURE.  ON FEBRUARY 8 AT 5:00PM, CPL BEGAN THE GRADUAL STARTUP OF THE PIPELINE SYSTEM.  THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY (OPS) REQUIRED CPL TO HOLD PRESSURE BETWEEN 200 TO 400 PSI FOR 1 HOUR.  THE STARTUP PROCESS WAS APPROVED BY OPS AT 7:45PM.  THE FINAL VOLUME RELEASED WAS DETERMINED TO BE 348 BARRELS AND THE RECOVERED VOLUME WAS 141 BARRELS.  THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) HAS ORDERED A LAB ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED PIECE OF PIPE TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE.

THE LEAK OBSERVED ON THAT DATE WAS BELOW THE REPORTING THRESHOLD.  A POST DISCOVERY INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE GRAVITOMETER, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN USED SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S, WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK.  MECHANICAL STRESSES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME CAUSED THE BOLTS INSIDE THE GRAVITOMETER TO COME LOOSE RESULTING IN THE GRAVITOMETER SAMPLE PROBE BASE TO TILT TO THE SIDE.  THIS TILTING ALLOWED REFINED PRODUCTS TO BYPASS THE GRAVITOMETER INTERNAL O-RING AND ENTER THE GRAVITOMETER ELECTRICAL ENCLOSURE THAT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO HOLD PIPELINE PRESSURES.  REFINED PRODUCT LEAKED FROM THE THREADED CONNECTIONS ON THE ELECTRICAL PORTION OF THE GRAVITOMETER INTO THE VAULT.  WOLVERINE HAS REMOVED THE GRAVITOMETER AND INSTALLED A BLIND FLANGE."

THIS ASSESSMENT WORK WAS DONE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE ILLINOIS EPA.  ALTHOUGH THE VEGETATION IN THE AREA GAVE NO INDICATION OF ANY PROBLEMS AT THE SURFACE, THE SOIL BORINGS DETECTED REFINED PRODUCTS 10 TO 12 FEET BELOW THE SOIL SURFACE.  THE EXTENSIVE BORINGS PERFORMED IN THE AREA GAVE A PRELIMINARY INDICATION OF THE PLUME SIZE AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE PLUME WAS NEAR BIG RUN CREEK (PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS MINK CREEK).  FURTHER, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A SHEEN ON BIG RUN CREEK.  APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS AFTER THE INITIAL DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK AND DURING WOLVERINE'S ACTIVE FOLLOW-UP PLUME DEFINITION AND PRELIMINARY REMEDIATION WORK, THE AREA EXPERIENCED EXTREMELY STRONG RAINS AND A SHEEN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED ON BIG RUN CREEK ON MARCH 5, 2002.  ALL APPROPRIATE REGULATORY REPORTS WERE MADE AT THAT TIME.  BIG RUN CREEK WAS PROMPTLY BOOMED WITH ABSORBENT PADS AND BOOMS DEPLOYED WHICH MET THE ILLINOIS EPA'S APPROVAL.  NO SHHEN HAS BEEN OBSERVED ON BIG RUN CREEK AT ANY TIME AFTER THE MARCH 5, 2002 REPORT.  WOLVERINE AND ITS CONTRACTORS ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING FURTHER SOIL BORINGS THAT WILL BETTER DEFINE THE PLUME SIZE AND FACILITATE THE PREPARATION OF A REMEDIATION PLAN.

APPROXIMATELY NINE HOURS AFTER INITIAL START-UP, THE STATION OPERATOR VISUALLY NOTED PRODUCT LEAKAGE FROM THE PUMP UNIT. AT THIS TIME, THE PUMP UNIT WAS SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT A TUBING FITTING, ASSOCIATED WITH THE PUMP INBOARD BEARING COOLING SYSTEM, HAD LEAKED RESULTING IN THE PRODUCT RELEASE. AFTER THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE TUBING COMPONENT DESIGN AND INSTALLATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TUBING FITTING HAD BEEN INSUFFICIENTLY TIGHTENED IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE. THE TUBE FITTING WAS REPAIRED, AND THE UNIT WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE. THE FITTING WAS TESTED DURING THE PUMP MANUFACTURER'S HYDROSTATIC TEST OF THE PUMP, AND WAS AGAIN SUBJECTED TO A 1 HOUR PNEUMATIC ""PROOF TEST"" UPON FINAL INSTALLATION. THE FACILITY IS OWNED BY CENTENNIAL PIPELINE LLC. 4/13/2010 UPDATED FOLLOWING QA/QC DATA QUALITY REVIEW.

THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE HAS BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  PER ANALYSIS BY KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES, IN A REPORT TITLED ""INVESTIGATION OF CAUSE OF FAILURE THE FAILURE OF WOODPAT CRUDE OIL PIPELINE"" DATED JULY 22, 2002, THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY HYDROGEN CRACK INITIATION AND PROPAGATION THROUGH THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE OF THE ELECTRIC-RESISTANCE-WELDED (ERW) LONGITUDINAL SEAM OF THE PIPE.  THE HYDROGEN CRACK WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL MANUFACTURE BUT APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF ATOMIC HYDROGEN INTO THE PIPELINE STEEL OVER TIME.  THE LABORATORY REPORT WAS SENT UNDER SEPARATE COVER TO MR. IVAN HUNTOON, DIRECTOR, CENTRAL REGION, OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY AUGUST 7, 2002.  OPS OVERSIGHT OF THE EVENT CONTINUES PER CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER CPF 3-2002-5007H.      THE REGULATORY REMEDIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND A NO FURTHER ACTION (NFA) LETTER DATED APRIL 2004 FROM THE ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.   IN DECEMBER 2005,MPL COMPLETED ITS ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION/RESTORATION BEYOND WHAT IS REGULATORY REQUIRED AT THE REQUEST OF LANDOWNERS.        4/20/2010 - UPDATED FOLLOWING QA/QC DATA QUALITY REVIEW.

BASED UPON THE VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE LEAK SITE, THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OR EXPECTATIONS THE PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM THE LEAK WOULD GENERATE COSTS THAT WOULD COME CLOSE TO OR EXCEED $50,000.  AFTER SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION WOULD BE NEEDED.  BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR A SUB-SURFACE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THE PROPERTY DAMAGE COSTS FROM THE LEAK HAD THE POTENTIAL TO APPROACH OR EXCEED $50,000.

THIS MANIFOLD CONTAINS SEVERAL LOW-PRESSURE BOOSTER PUMPS THAT ARE USED TO PUMP PRODUCT FROM BREAKOUT TANKS TO HIGH-PRESSURE MAIN LINE PUMPS LOCATED IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PUMP STATION.  THE VALVE BODY OF A DARLING GATE VALVE (VALVE NO. 696), LOCATED ON THE BOOSTER PUMP DISCHARGE MANIFOLD, FAILED DUE TO OVERPRESSURE FROM HIGH-PRESSURE BLEEDING OFF THE MAIN LINE PUMP DISCHARGE MANIFOLD.  THE DARLING GATE VALVE, RATED AT 200 PSI WORKING PRESSURE, WAS SUBJECT TO A PRESSURE OF 1,080 PSI THAT WAS BLEEDING ACROSS A BLOCK VALVE AND 2 CHECK VALVES.     THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE IS THE OVERPRESSURE OF THE DARLING GATE VALVE NO. 696.  A SECOND IMMEDIATE CAUSE IS THE INTERNAL SEALING FAILURE OF BLOCK VALVE NO. 138 AND 2 CHECK VALVES ON THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE OF NO. 2 MAIN LINE PUMP.

EDT A FARMER CONTACTED THE MARATHON ASHLAND PIPE LINE (MAPL) OPERATIONS CENTER (OC) AND REPORTED A ""SPRAY"" SHOOTING UP IN THE AIR AT MAPL'S STATE LINE STATION. THE IN/OH STATE LINE- LIMA METERING LINE SEGMENT WAS SHUT DOWN AND SECURED BY THE MAPL OC WHO ALSO CONTACTED LIMA AREA PERSONNEL AND INFORMED THEM OF A PROBLEM AT STATE LINE STATION. LIMA AREA PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY ACTIVATED MAPL'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES. UPON ARRIVING AT STATE LINE STATION, LIMA PERSONNEL OBSERVED AN OILY/GAS FILM ON THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE MAINLINE PUMP. THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS QUICKLY DETERMINED TO BE THE INBOARD SEAL FLUSH LINE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 3/8"" STAINLESS STEEL TUBING HAD FAILED. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED, BUT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. A 40'X 50' AREA AROUND THE PUMP HAD AREAS OF POOLED LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL. SMALLER AREAS OUTSIDE THE FENCE ON MAPL PROPERTY ALSO SHOWED SIGNS OF DIESEL FUEL CONTAMINATION. IMPACTED SURFACE GRAVEL AND SOIL WERE COLLECTED IN ROLL-OFF CONTAINERS, AND WILL BE DISPOSED OF PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL WASTE REGULATIONS. THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS QUICKLY DETERMINED TO BE THE INBOARD SEAL FLUSH LINE.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 3/8"" STAINLESS STEEL TUBING HAD FAILED.  A MATERIALS FAILURE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES INC, CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE TUBING FAILURE WAS FATIGUE CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE VIBRATION OF THE TUBING LINE INDUCED BY THE PUMP.  NO EVIDENCE OF IMPROPER INSTALLATION OR PRIOR DAMAGE TO THE TUBING WAS NOTED (FROM EXAMINING THE TUBE SPECIMEN).  FRACTOGRAPHIC AND METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY INDICATIONS OF CORROSION-FATIGUE CRACKING (CFC), STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING (SCC), OR HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT.  MAPL'S INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT INSUFFICIENT TUBING SUPPORT WAS PROVIDED.  THE TUBING MANUFACTURER SPECIFICES 3' SPACING OF TUBING SUPPORTS WHILE 5' SPACING WAS USED IN THIS INSTALLATION.      4/20/2010 - UPDATED FOLLOWING QA/QC DATA QUALITY REVIEW. LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE WERE ORIGINALLY REVERSED, SO THEY HAVE BEEN CORRECTED.  ALSO, AMOUNT SPILL AND RECOVERED WERE UPDATED TO FROM 15 AND 13 TO 18 AND 16, RESPECTIVELY. CAUSE WAS UPDATED FROM 24-MISCELLANEOUS TO 15-COMPONENT - 3/8"" STAINLESS STEEL TUBING PER NARRATIVE AND A REVIEW OF THE PROJECT. SEE NARRATIVE ABOVE FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT. POOR WORKMANSHIP WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. H5 B AND C WERE ALSO UPDATED. SINCE THIS TUBING IS A COMPONENT AND NOT PIPE, LEAK PRESSURE TEST INFORMATION IS NOT APPLICABLE."

INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO MANAGEMENT, PIPELINE CONTROL, PIPELINE SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE, AND THE NRC.  THE LEAK OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS EARLIER WHEN THE 1/4"" CHECK VALVE COMING FROM THE CHEMICAL INJECTION PUMP RUPTURED, ALLOWING CRUDE OIL IN THE SUCTION LINE TO THE DISCHARGE PUMPS TO MIGRATE OUT OF THE BREAK AND INTO A CONCRETE CONTAINMENT AREA, OVERFLOWING AROUND THE CONTAINMENT.  THE SPILL WAS HALTED BY CLOSING A 1/4"" VALVE GOING INTO THE SUCTION LINE.  LOCAL PERSONNEL RESPONDED, EXCAVATED 6 CUBIC YARDS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL AND REMOVED IT TO AN AREA INSIDE THE STATION FOR REMEDIATION.  SOIL SAMPLING WAS COMPLETED AND THE AREA CLEANED.  COSTS ARE ESTIMATED AT $656.00.  INITIALLY, THIS RELEASE WAS REPORTED AS A 10 BARREL RELEASE, BUT DURING THE CLEAN-UP PHASE OF THE RESPONSE PERIOD, THE CONCRETE CONTAINMENT WAS DISCOVERED BENEATH THE OVERSPRAY OF CRUDE OIL.  THE ACCURATED FIGURES ARE 5 BARRELS RELEASED AND 3 BARRELS RECOVERED FROM THE CONTAINMENT.  NEW PREVENTATIVE MEASURES WERE ACCOMPLISHED BY REPLACING THE 3/8"" STAINLESS STEEL TUBING COMING FROM THE CORROSION CHEMICAL INJECTION AND THE 1/4"" CHECK VALVE.      4/20/2010 -- REPORT UPDATED PER RESULTS OF LEAK REVIEW SPRING 2010.

THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AND SPLP PERSONNEL RESPONDED ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM PA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (PADEP).  SPLP, PADEP AND SEWER AUTHORITY REPRESENTATIVES WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE ANY SOURCE FOR THE PETROLEUM VAPORS IN THE SEWER SYSTEM AND THE VAPORS ABATED.  THE PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED AND RAN FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL VAPORS AGAIN WERE AGAIN DETECTED IN THE SEWER SYSTEM ON THE MORNING OF MONDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SAME THREE ENTITIES AGAIN SEARCHED FOR A SOURCE.  THIS TIME A LEAKING FLANGE WAS FOUND AFTER EXCAVATION OF AN 8-INCH DELIVERY SPUR-LINE TAKE-OFF VALVE.      MIXED PRODUCT WAS FOUND IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE TAKE-OFF MANIFOLD AND HAD ENTERED THE SEWER SYSTEM VIA A NEARBY SEWER LATERAL.  THE LEAK WAS ISOLATED, THE SECTION OF PIPELINE AND MANIFOLD DRAINED, AND A REPAIR WAS MADE BY REPLACING THE GASKET.      INITIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE INCLUDED THE EXCAVATION OF SURFACE RECOVERY SUMPS AND USE OF VACUUM TRUCKS TO RECOVER PRODUCT AND CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER FROM THESE SUMPS.  VENTING OF THE SEWER SYSTEM WAS ALSO DONE.  TO DATE, 600 GALLONS OF MIXED PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECOVERED.  ADDITIONALLY, TEN MONITORING WELLS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AND THOSE, ALONG WITH SEVERAL NEARBY POTABLE WATER WELLS, HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO CHARACTERIZE THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.  NO TRACE OF PRODUCT IS EVIDENT IN ANY OF THE POTABLE WATER WELLS, WHICH ARE LOCATED HYDRAULICALLY UP GRADIENT.  A LONG TERM IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION PLAN IS BEING DEVELOPED."

THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT WAS SIZED TO HANDLE APPROXIMATELY 80 BBLS BUT THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DRAIN VALVE HAD NOT BEEN RECLOSED FOLLOWING MAINTENANCE IN THE PRECEDING WEEK ALLOWING CRUDE TO BE DISCHARGED OFF SITE. THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED BY THE OPERATOR WHILE WALKING TO VEHICLE AT THE END OF WORK SHIFT. THE HIGH LEVEL SWITCH WAS OF A MECHANICAL FLOAT TYPE WITH TWO LEVELS OF ALARM AND HAD BEEN INSTALLED NEW 3 MONTHS PRIOR. IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY TESTED AT INSTALLATION AND IT WORKED AFTER THE SOURCE OF CRUDE FLOW WAS STOPPED. NO REPORT OR RECORD COULD BE FOUND THAT INDICATED A CAUSE FOR THE OPEN DRAIN VALVE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE VALVE DID NOT HAVE A LATCHING OR LOCKING MECHANISM TO MAINTAIN IT IN THE PROPER CLOSED POSITION WITHOUT DELIBERATE OPERATOR ACTION. INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT FAILURE OF THE LEVEL ALARM SYSTEM ALLOWED THE RELEASE OUT OF CONTAINMENT. THE HIGH LEVEL SYSTEM WILL BE UPGRADED WITH THE ADDITION OF AN ULTRASONIC LEVEL DETECTOR. SIMILAR FIRST VALVES OFF THE PIPELINE HAVE BEEN SURVEYED AND ARE BEING SECURED IN THE PROPER OPERATING POSITION."

RESPONSE WAS LIMITED TO LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TOWNSHIP OFFICIALS.  PA DEP, US COAST GUARD, US FISH & WILDLIFE AND OPS HAVE MADE ON-SITE INSPECTIONS OF THE LEAK LOCATION.  NO IMPACT TO DARBY CREEK IS EVIDENT.    THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE CAN NOT CONCLUSIVELY BE DETERMINED SINCE THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPELINE CAN NOT BE RETRIEVED BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF DAMAGING AN ADJACENT BUILDING DUE TO ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE PIPELINE. THE PIPELINE SECTION AT THE LEAK IS APPROXIMATELY 12 FEET DEEP FOR A CROSSING OF DARBY CREEK.  THE PIPELINE HAD ILI BY A HIGH-RESOLUTION ULTRASONIC PIG DEVICE IN OCTOBER 2001 WITH REPORT BEING RECEIVED IN JANUARY 2002.  THE SECTION OF LINE THAT LEAKED HAD A REPORTED FEATURE AND WAS SCHEDULED TO BE FIELD INVESTIGATED AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK. IN ORDER TO GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE, A VIDEO CAMERA WAS RUN INSIDE THE FAILED PIPE SECTION TO LOCATE AND EXAMINE THE FAILURE LOCATION.  THIS INTERNAL VIDEO INSPECTION CONFIRMED THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK AS BEING THE SAME LOCATION AS THAT REPORT BY THE ILI.

THE LINE WAS ALREADY IN A SCHEDULED SHUTDOWN PERIOD.  EMERGENCY PROCEDURES WERE ACTIVATED, AND STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT.  CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT WAS MOBILIZED TO THE SCENE TO EXCAVATE TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE HYDROCARBON.  IMPACTED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND PLACED ON PLASTIC SHEETING, AND SOIL CHARACTERIZATION SAMPLES WERE TAKEN TO DETERMINE PROPER DISPOSAL METHODS PER LADEQ REQUIREMENTS.  SOIL BORINGS WERE MADE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF IMPACT.  THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE ORIGINATING FROM THE VALVE BONNET ASSEMBLY.  THE VALVE WAS REMOVED AND A REPLACEMENT VALVE INSTALLED.  THE LEAKING VALVE ASSEMBLY WAS SHIPPED TO THE VALVE MANUFACTURER FOR EVALUATION.  THE CAUSE OF THE BONNET ASSEMBLY FAILURE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME BUT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  UPDATED COMMENTS 7/3/02.  THE SOURCE OF THE LEAS WAS A VALVE BONNET ASSEMBLY O-RING.  THE MOSE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE LEAKAGE  WAS EXCESSIVE GREASE IN THE WRONG AREA DURING ASSEMBLY (BY THE MANUFACTURER/REPAIR CONTRACTOR).  PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE CHANGES PROBABLY CAUSED FURTHER MOVEMENT OF THE O-RING, EVENTUALLY CAUSING THE LEAK.  THE REPAIR O-RINGS FURNISHED BY THE MANUFACTURER WERE DEFECTIVE IN INSIE DIAMETER SIZE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.  THE INVESTIGATION IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE, HOWEVER ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY BE IDENTIFIED AT A LATER DATE.  11-8-04  THE RELEASE VOLUME, IMPACTED SOIL VOLUME, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ESTIMATES WERE REVISED 04-04-2003. MAPL HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PROPERTY DAMAGE AS OF THE 04-04-2003 UPDATE AND THEREFORE IS PROVIDING THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY WITH A FINAL 7000-1 REPORT REGARDING THE 1-08-2002 EVENT AT THE SORRENTO, LA BLOCK VALVE SITE."

THIS REPORT WAS DELAYED BECAUSE THE COST, WHICH EVENTUALLY SURPASSED THE $50,000.00 REPORTING CRITERIA, WAS NOT ANTICIPATED. THE COSTS WERE INCURRED BECAUSE OF THE GREAT EXPENSE TO GET EQUIPMENT INTO THE AREA. DIFFICULTY IN REPORTING WAS EXPERIENCED IN PREVIOUS TRIES AT SUBMITTING.

THE CHANGE IN STATUS DUE TO THE EXPENSES INCURRED AND THE REPORTING DIFFICULTIES, COMBINED, ACCOUNT FOR THE TIMING OF THIS SUBMITAL.

IT APPEARS THAT THE CRUDE OIL STREAM WAS REDUCED RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE NGLS BEING RECEIVED AT THE PMT STATION.  THE NGLS WERE DISCHARGED AS A VAPOR FROM THE PUMPING EQUIPMENT.  THE MECHANISM FOR THIS IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.  THE CONCENTRATION OF NGL VAPORS ULTIMATELY CAME IN CONTACT WITH AN IGNITION SOURCE RESULTING IN AN EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE.  THE INCIDENT WAS REPORT TO PMT BY TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION FROM AN OUTSIDE PARTY.  COMPANY PERSONNEL AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT.  THE EQUIPMENT WAS ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINES BY CLOSING VALVES.  FIRE DEPARTMENT COMMAND MADE A DECISION TO ALLOW THE FIRE TO BURN ITSELF OUT.  ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT (LESS THAT 10 GALLONS) OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED FROM THE PUMP AREA.  ALL OIL WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE PUMP CONTAINMENT AREA.  THE COMPANY IS INVESTIGATING THE ACCIDENT.  A DECISION HAS NOT BEEN MADE AS TO WHEN OR IF THE FACILITY MAY BE PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE.  THE FACILITY WILL REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE INDEFINITELY.

INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO MANAGEMENT, PIPELINE CONTROL, PIPELINE SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE, AND THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS.  THIS PUMP STATION IS PART OF A NON REGULATED CRUDE OIL GATHERING SYSTEM  IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE.  THE LEAK OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS EARLIER WHEN A WELD ON THE INLET 3"" SCRAPER TRAP CRACKED DUE TO INTERNAL CORROSION.  THE SPILL WAS HALTED BY SHUTTING DOWN THE PUMP AND CLOSING THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES ON THE TRAP.  DUE TO FREEZING CONDITIONS AND ICING ON THE TERRAIN, THE ESTIMATED 30 BARRELS OF SPILLED CRUDE OIL DEVELOPED A WIDE DISPERSION AREA PENETRATING THE GROUND APPROXIMATELY 2"" DEEP.  A DECISION WAS MADE TO CONTAIN THE SPILL AND REMEDIATE IT IN PLACE.  SOIL SAMPLING WAS COMPLETED AND REMEDIATION BEGAN IMMEDIATELY.  TOTAL COSTS ARE ESTIMATED AT $2398.00.  INTERNAL CORROSION WAS CONFIRMED AS THE CAUSE DURING REPLACEMENT OF THE TRAP BARREL.  WATER FALLING OUT OF THE CRUDE OIL HAD CORRODED THE WELD UNTIL IT GAVE AWAY.  NEW PREVENTATIVE MEASURES WERE ACCOMPLISHED BY REPLACING THE INLET SCRAPER TRAP BARREL."

OPERATIONS CONTROL CENTER WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE WAS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE TO INSTALL THE TEST PORT. THE UPSTREAM BLOCK VALVE, #56, WAS CLOSED AS WELL AS THE DOWNSTREAM VALVE, #36. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BLOCK VALVES IS APPROXIMATELY SIX FEET. THE PLUG IN THE UPSTREAM PORTION OF THE RELIEF VALVE WAS LOOSENED AND UNSCREWED SLOWLY. ONCE REMOVED, OIL BEGAN TO FLOW OUT OF THE VALVE BODY, THE MACHINIST ON SITE PUSHED THE STATION EMERGENCY STOP AND BEGAN CLOSING PUMP SUCTION VALVES, THINKING THE PRESSURE WAS HEAD PRESSURE FROM TANKAGE. AT THAT TIME, A GAUGER ARRIVED AND CLOSED THE STATION DISCHARGE VALVE, #45, AND THE FLOW CEASED. THE BLOCK VALVE UPSTREAM OF THE RELIEF VALVE DID NOT HOLD ALLOWING CRUDE OIL TO ESCAPE FROM THE 1/2"" THREADED OPENING IN THE RELIEF VALVE BODY.

THE L-PIPE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND THE 1-INCH VALVE HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE VERTICAL POSITION ALLOWING ANY FUTURE ICE EXPANSION TO ESCAPE INTO THE LARGER 12-INCH PROVER PIPE RUN.  ALL SIMILAR VALVE INSTALLATIONS AT SAMARIA, MI AND OREGON, OH HAVE BEEN UPGRADED TO PREVENT A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE."

WHEN THE PUMP WAS SHUT DOWN, OIL LEAKING INTO SUMP STOPPED.  THERE WAS NO HIGH PRESSURE INDICATING THAT THE RELIEF VALVE FAILED, BUT NO OTHER SOURCE FOUND TO BE LEAKING.  A RETEST WAS DONE ON THE VALVE AND SHOWED IT TO BE OK.  TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, THE RELIEF VALVES ON ALL PUMPS WERE REPLACED AND TESTED.  ALSO, THE PIPING FROM THE RELIEF VALVES WAS PIPED SO THEY WOULD DISCHARGE INTO A TANK RECEIVING LINE INSTEAD OF THE SUMP.  A HIGH SUMP ALARM HAD FAILED DUE TO POWER FAILURE ON THE SUMP, SO THE HIGH SUMP ALARM WAS CONNECTED TO ITS OWN POWER SOURCE.  THEN THE ALARM AND SUMP CONTROL WAS CONNECTED TO THE SCADA CONTROL."

TWO 12"" STOPPLE FITTINGS AND FOUR 2"" TOR FITTINGS WERE PLANNED TO BE INSTALLED.  THE INSTALLATION OF THE 2"" TOR FITTINGS INVOLVES HOT TAPPING THE LINE TO MAKE THE FITTING FUNCTIONAL.  THIS ENABLES THE EXISTING LINE TO BE DRAINED THROUGH THE TOR FITTING AND A 2"" VALVE THAT IS ATACHED TO IT.  WHILE PERFORMING THE HOT TAP ASSOCIATED WITH THE THIRD 2"" TOR FITTING, THE 2"" VALVE THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE 2"" TOR FITTING FAILED TO HOLD PRESSURE.  THIS LED TO A RELEASE OF GASOLINE WHEN THE TAPPING TOOL WAS REMOVED FROM THE 2"" VALVE.  THE RELEASE IMMEDIATELY REACHED A HEIGHT OF ~60' FOR A FEW MINUTES.  THE STREAM HAD DECREASED TO ~3' BY 0945 HRS AND TO A 1' BY ~1130 HRS.  THREE CONTRACT EMPLOYEES WERE INVOLVED IN THIS HOT TAPPING PROCESS BUT THEY WERE NOT INJURED.

NO HYDROLOGIC CONNECTION EXISTS BETWEEN THAT STOCKPOND AND WATERS OF THE U.S. THIS SPILL DID NOT RESULT IN WATER POLLUTION AS DESCRIBED UNDER 49 CFR 195.52(A)(4).  ON MARCH 26, 2003 OPERATION COORDINATOR TANE HARTMAN RECEIVED LOW PRESSURE ALARMS ON SCADA AT ELK MOUNTAIN STATION (16:56:38) AND SINCLAIR STATION (16:57:10), AND A SINCLAIR HIGH RATE ALARM (16:57:17).  TANE INITIATED SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES ON THE LINE AT 16:57:30, BY SHUTTING DOWN THE PUMPING UNITS AT SINCLAIR AND CLOSING BLOCK VALVES AT SINCLAIR, LARAMIE STATION, LOVELAND STATION AND DENVER PRODUCTS TERMINAL.  AT THE TIME, THE LINEFILL CONSISTED ON 32,215 BBLS OF #2 FUEL OIL AND 10,124 BBLS OF GASOLINE.  AT 60,000 BBL GASOLINE BATCH HAD BEEN STARTED AT 04:30.  LOGS INDICATE THAT LINE PRESSURE AT SINCLAIR WAS 1721 PSI AND 1360 PSI AT ELK MOUNTAIN PRIOR TO THE RUPTURE.  SINCLAIR WAS RUNNING THREE UNITS IN SERIES, CONTROLLING ON DISCHARGE, WITH A SETPOINT OF 1730 PSI.  NO INTERMEDIATE PUMP STATIONS WERE IN OPERATION.  DRAG REDUCER WAS BEING INJECTED AT SINCLAIR AND THE RATE ON THE LINE WAS APPROXIMATELY 810 BPH.  THIS WAS THE NORMAL OPERATION FOR THIS PIPELINE.  INTERNAL NOTIFICATION BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LINE WAS SHUTDOWN AND BLOCKED IN.  OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR CHRIS FLACK AND OIL MOVEMENTS SUPERVISOR PAT WILSON WERE THE FIRST CALLED.  CHRIS WAS AT THE CONTROL CENTER WITHIN 20 MINUTES AND HAD STARTED MAKING FURTHER INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WHILE ON ROUTE, INCLUDING NOTIFICATION TO MARK PETERSEN, SINCLAIRS MANAGER OF PIPELINES AND TERMINALS IN SALT LAKE CITY.  SINCLAIR PIPELINE (SPL) EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO SECTIONALIZE THE LINE BETWEEN LARAMIE STATION AND SINCLAIR.  PRESSURE WAS HOLDING AT LARAMIE AND PRESSURE CONTINUED TO DROP AT ELK MOUNTAIN.  BOTH THE CARBON COUNTY AND ALBANY COUNTY SHERIFFS WERE CALLED TO NOTIFY OF A POSSIBLE LEAK AND TO REPORT TO US ANY REPORTS OF GASOLINE ODORS ETC.  DISTRICT MANAGER BARRY BLUTH, WHO WAS WESTBOUND ON I-80 BETWEEN LARAMIE AND CHEYENNE AT THE TIME OF NOTIFICATION, WAS THE FIRST TO REPORT AN ODOR WHEN HE CROSSED THE MEDICINE BOW RIVER IN ELK MOUNTAIN.  HE PROCEEDED TO CLOSE THE ELK MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY BLOCK VALVE (18:48) AND JON BROWN CLOSED THE BARTLETT BLOCK VALVE (18:52) THEREBY ISOLATING THE MEDICINE BOW RIVER CROSSING.  BARRY ALSO REPORTED MORE GASOLINE ODORS AT THE ELK MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY BLOCK VALVE.  A STRONG WEST WIND WAS BLOWING AND IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RELEASE HAD TO BE WEST OF THE VALVE.  BY 18:00 THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT HAD BEGUN MOBILIZING A VAC TRUCK, SPILL TRAILERS, A DOZER AND SPLS BACK HOE TO ELK MOUNTAIN.  MORE PERSONNEL WERE ON HAND AND FOOT PATROLS AND A 4-WHEELER HEADED WEST FROM THE ELK MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY VALVE.  WINDS WERE BLOWING @ 30 TO 40 MPH WITH SNOW FALLING.  THE WEATHER IMPAIRED EFFORTS FOR OFF ROAD TRAVEL, SO TRAVERSING THE ROW WAS DIFFICULT.  ALSO ATTEMPTS TO REACH ELK MOUNTAIN MANAGER, DAVID SPAUGH WAS CONTACTED AND HE ASSISTED BREAKING THROUGH THE DRIFTS AND HIS TRACTOR, ENABLING AREA OPERATOR JIM WILLCOX AND PAT WILSON TO REACH ELK MOUNTAIN STATION (21:21).  PAT AND JIM IMMEDIATELY LOCATED THE LEAK APPROXIMATELY 100' UP STREAM OF ELK MOUNTAIN STATION.  ONCE CONFIRMED, ALL RESPONDING PERSONNEL REPORTED TO ELK MT. STATION.  AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY NO FLOW WAS APPARENT OUT OF THE LEAK SITE.  ASSESSMENT OF SPILL SIZE AND SPREAD BEGAN, WITH THE PONDS LOCATED TO THE NORTH OF THE STATION AS THE HIGHEST CONCERN.  ONCE CONFIRMED, ALL RESPONDING PERSONNEL REPORTED TO ELK MT. STATION.  AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY NO FLOW WAS APPARENT OUT OF THE LEAK SITE.  ASSESSMENT OF SPILL SIZE AND SPREAD BEGAN, WITH THE PONDS LOCATED TO THE NORTH OF THE STATION AS THE HIGHEST CONCERN.  AN INCIDENT COMMAND POST AND STAGING AREA WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE ELK MOUNTAIN I-80 INTERCHANGE.  THE SOUTHEAST WYOMING OIL SPILL ASSOCIATION (SWOONS) SPILL TRAILER FROM CASPER ARRIVED AT 21:00.  BECAUSE OF THE INCLEMENT WEATHER AND THE CLOSURE OF I-80, THE DOZER DID NOT REACH THE SITE, HOWEVER HYLAND TRUCKING WAS ABLE TO GET SPLS BACKHOE TO THE STAGING AREA BY 23:00.  THE CONTROL CENTER CONTACTED THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND OBTAINED A WAIVER TO THE ROAD CLOSURE FOR RESPONDING PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT.  A TRAILER VACUUM TRUCK FROM HYLAND ALSO MADE IT TO THE STAGING AREA.  THE CONDITION OF THE ROAD FROM THE STAGING AREA INTO THE STATION DID NOT PERMIT EITHER OF THE VAC TRUCKS ACCESS.  CHRIS FLACK MADE NOTIFICATION TO THE NRC AND WYOMING DE AT 22:15 AND 22:26 RESPECTIVELY.  MATERIAL FROM SPLS SPILL TRAILER WAS BROUGHT FROM THE STAGING AREA TO THE LEAK SITE TO CONTAIN THE EXTENT OF THE SPILL.  A GENERATOR AND PORTABLE LIGHTS WERE DEPLOYED.  ABSORBENT BOOMS AND PADS WERE INSTALLED AT THE EDGE OF THE SPILL SITE.  CONTAINMENT WAS ACHIEVED AND PERSONNEL LEFT THE SITE AT 01:00. 2-24-04 METALURIGICAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT A DENT WITH GOUGE WAS THE CAUSE OF FAILURE."

WHILE IN THE AREA, THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED AN AREA OF DEAD VEGETATION APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE PIPELINE R/W AND A LIGHT SHEEN LEACHING OUT OF THE SOUTH BANK OF THE NEAR-BY MIDDLE BRANCH ROUGE RIVER.  THE SHEEN DISSIPATED TO THE ATMOSPHERE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SHORE.  DUE TO SCHEDULE, THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUTDOWN FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WAS UNDER 470 PSI STATIC PRESSURE.  THE LINE CONTAINED BUTANE.  MLVS WERE CLOSED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LEAK LOCATION.      PIPELINE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND MAINTENANCE CREWS RESPONDED.  AN ADSORBENT BOOM WAS PLACED AROUND THE SHEEN TO PREVENT ANY MIGRATION DOWN RIVER.  THE AREA OF THE DEAD VEGETATION WAS EXCAVATED EXPOSING THE PIPELINE AND A LARGE HALF-BARREL CONTAINER OF PITCH LOCATED ON TOP OF THE PIPELINE.  DUE TO AN EXTREMELY SLOW LEAK RATE, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LEAK LOCATION.  A REVIEW OF LINE DRAWINGS INDICATED THAT A STOPPLE FITTING HAD BEEN INSTALLED AT THIS LOCATION IN 1961.  ILI RECORDS FROM A 1998 MFL PIG RUN INDICATED NO REMARKABLE FEATURES AT THIS LOCATION.  IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM THE HALF-BARREL CONTAINER THAT CONTAINED THE STOPPLE FITTING.  BUTANE WAS BLED OFF AND PUMPED INTO AN ADJACENT FACILITY TO REDUCE PRESSURE.  THE LINE WAS NITROGEN PURGED OF BUTANE ON MAY 9.      THE LEAKING STOPPLE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH A SECTION OF NEW PRE-PRESSURE TESTED PIPE ON MAY 12.  AN IDENTICAL STOPPLE FITTING LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER WAS ALSO REMOVED AND REPLACED.  THE LINE WAS REFILLED AND PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON MAY 16.    A FORENSIC FAILURE INVESTIGATION OF THE STOPPLE FITTING WAS CONDUCTED BY THE STAFF OF THE SUNOCO PIPELINE INKSTER OFFICE.  THIS INCLUDED WELDING END CAPS ON THE SECTION OF LINE, PRESSURE TESTING THE STOPPLE FITTING AND LATER DISASSEMBLY OF THE STOPPLE DEVICE.  THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT THE RTJ STYLE FLANGE ASSEMBLY ON THE TOP OF THE STOPPLE FITTING HAD A VERY SMALL LEAK MIGRATING BETWEEN THE FLANGE FACES AND THE RTJ GASKET.     WILL POTENTIALLY BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM LIMITED SOIL REMEDIATION BY MIDEQ."

ESD VALVE 3 IS AN AIR-ACTUATED VALVE THAT OPENS WHEN INSTRUMENT AIR IS SUPPLIED TO THE VALVE ACTUATOR.  ON TUESDAY, 7/08/03, A DYNEGY PIPELINE TECH WENT TO THE SOUR LAKE PUMP STATION TO PREPARE IT FOR THE BLIND INSTALLATION TO BE COMPLETE ON WED. 7/9/03.  HE CLOSED ESD VALVE 3 AND  DE-PRESSURED THE DOWNSTREAM PIPING.  HE NEXT FLAGGED THE VALVE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE SOLENOID AND THE SOLENOID BYPASS VALVE WITH PINK FLAGGING TO SIGNIFY THAT THESE VALVES WERE TO BE CLOSED TO PREVENT ESD VALVE 3 FROM BEING OPENED.  A CONTRACT I&E TECHNICIAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TESTS.  HE ALSO GAVE THE TECHNICIAN INSTRUCTIONS TO CLOSE THE MAIN AIRLINE VALVE TO ESD 3.  THE I&E TECHNICIAN CLOSED THE BYPASS AND SOLENOID VALVES, BUT DID NOT CLOSE THE MAIN AIRLINE VALVE TO ESD 3.  NO LOCKS OR TAGS WERE APPLIED TO THE VALVES.  ON WEDNESDAY, 7/9/03 BENTON CONSTRUCTION WAS ASSIGNED THE JOB OF INSTALLING THE BLIND ON ESD VALVE 3.  THAT MORNING, A DYNEGY PIPELINE TECH WENT TO THE SOUR LAKE PUMP STATION TO VERIFY THAT THE PIPING WAS DE-PRESSURED AND IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF WHERE THE BLIND WAS TO BE INSTALLED.  HE VERIFIED THE PIPING WAS DE-PRESSURED, AND HE FLAGGED THE LOCATION OF WHERE THE BLIND WAS TO BE INSTALLED WITH GREEN FLAGGING.  HE DID NOT CHECK THE POSITION OF THE ESD VALVE OR THE POSITION OF THE VALVES ON THE AIR SUPPLY LINES.  HE THEN CALLED THE BENTON CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, WHO WAS IN ROUTE (WITH HIS CREW) TO THE STATION, AND INFORMED HIM THE STATION WAS DE-PRESSURED AND GREEN FLAGGING HAD BEEN PLACED ON THE FLANGE WHERE THE BLIND WAS TO BE INSTALLED.  THE DYNEGY PIPELINE TECH THEN LEFT THE SOUR LAKE PUMP STATION TO ATTEND TO OTHER TASKS BEING COMPLETED THAT DAY.  BEFORE STARTING WORK, THE BENTON CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN VERIFIED THE PIPING WAS DE-PRESSURED AND THE VENT VALVES WERE OPEN.  HE ALSO VERIFIED THAT ESD VALVE 3 WAS CLOSED.  HE DID NOT CHECK THE POSITION OF ESD 3 AIR SUPPLY VALVES.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, BENTON CONSTRUCTION PERSONNEL HAD INSTALLED THE BLIND AND ALL THE FLANGE BOLTS HAD BEEN HAND TIGHTENED.  AS THE CREW WAS PREPARING TO COMPLETELY TIGHTEN THE FLANGE BOLTS, THE SOLENOID BYPASS VALVE WAS INADVERTENTLY OPENED, AND AIR WAS SUPPLIED TO THE VALVE ACTUATOR.  ESD VALVE 3 OPENED AND PROPANE WAS RELEASED FROM THE SPACE BETWEEN THE VALVE AND THE SKILLET BLIND.  EVEN THOUGH THE STATION'S INSTRUMENT AIR COMPRESSOR WAS SHUT DOWN, THE BACKUP NITROGEN BOTTLES KEPT INSTRUMENT AIR SUPPLIED TO THE ESD VALVE 3.  BECAUSE THE SOLENOID BYPASS VALVE WAS OPEN, THE HACKBERRY OPERATOR WAS NOT ABLE TO CLOSE THE ESD VALVE.  THE LEAK CONTINUED UNTIL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SHUT OFF THE INSTRUMENT AIR SUPPLIED FROM THE NITROGEN BOTTLES TO ESD VALVE 3."

BUCKEYE WAS NOTIFIED THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN AND A CREW SENT TO THE SITE IMMEDIATELY.      A LEHEY CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AS A TEMPORARY REPAIR.  A PERMANENT REPAIR WAS MADE BY REPLACING THE DAMAGE SECTION OF PIPELINE WITH PRE-CERTIFIED PIPE BEFORE THE PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED.      THE EXCAVATOR HAD NOTIFIED BUCKEYE THROUGH THE CT ONE CALL SYSTEM ON MAY 15,2003, OF HIS INTENT TO INSTALL A WATER LINE.  A BUCKEYE EMPLOYEE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE AND DETERMINED THAT BUCKEYE WAS IN THE AREA.  THE BUCKEYE EMPLOYEE LOCATED BUCKEYE'S PIPELINE USING A LINE LOCATOR AND PLACED FLAGS OVER THE PIPELINE.  THE EMPLOYEE ALSO DISCUSSED WITH THE EXCAVATOR BUCKEYE'S REQUIREMENTS.  A BUCKEYE EMPLOYEE WAS SENT TO THE SITE ROUTINELY TO INSPECT THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK BY THE EXCAVATOR.      WHEN THE BUCKEYE EMPLOYEE MARKED THE PIPELINE HE DID NOT ACTUALLY MARK THE PIPELINE BUT INADVERTENTLY MARKED A RECTIFIER CABLE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE PIPELINE.  AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE EXCAVATOR HIT BUCKEYE'S PIPELINE THE CABLE WHICH WAS MARKED AS THE PIPELINE WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET FROM THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE.      THE EXCAVATOR CONTACTED THE CT ONE CALL SYSTEM FOR THIS WORK ON MAY 15, 2003.  UNDER CT LAW THE EXCAVATION NOTICE EXPIRES AT THE END OF 30 DAYS.  IF THE EXCAVATOR HAS NOT COMPLETED WITH THE WORK IN 30 DAYS A RENEWAL NOTICE IS REQUIRED.  THE EXCAVATOR DID NOT SUBMIT A RENEWAL NOTICE TO THE CT ONE CALL SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, THE EXCAVATOR WAS WORKING IN THE AREA FOLLOWING BUCKEYE'S MARKINGS.  THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS CHANGED TO EXCAVATOR DAMAGE FROM INCORRECT OPERATION AT THE REQUEST BY MR. ALEX DANKANICH FROM THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY."

THE WIND DIRECTION DID NOT WARRANT CLOSING STATE HIGHWAY 77, BUT THE EVENT DID WARRANT CLOSING A SECTION OF A RAILROAD  NEXT TO THE INCIDENT.  DUE TO THE LENGTH OF THE FLARING OPERATIONS, PULLING THE PIPE OUT OF THE CASING, PERMANENT REPAIR WAS NOT COMPLETED UNTIL AUGUST 7, 2003.

BUCKEYE PIPE LINE COMPANY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN WAS INITIATED IMMEDIATELY.

BY AUGUST 16, 2003 APPROXIMATELY 717 FEET OF PIPE HAD BEEN REPLACED AND HYDROTESTED WITH ALL WELDS BEING RADIOGRAPHICALLY EXAMINED.  ON AUGUST 21, 2003 THE PIPELINE WAS REFILLED AND A ONE HOUR INTEGRITY PRESSURE TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THIS PIPELINE SECTION ON AUGUST 25, 2003.  THE PIPELINE RESTARTED OPERATIONS ON AUGUST 29, 2003 AT A REDUCED MOP OF 380 PSI.      THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE WAS SHIPPED TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR ANALYSIS.

KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FINAL ANALYSIS REPORT STATES: ""WE BELIEVE THAT STRESSES INDUCED BY THE RECENT REHABILITATION WORK THAT WAS PERFORMED WITHIN 20 FEET OF THIS LOCATION IN COMBINATION WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOL MAY HAVE CAUSED MOVEMENT AND THUS OVER STRESS OF THE GIRTH WELD DUE TO POSSIBLE MISALIGNMENT OF THE JOINT THEREBY CAUSING IT TO FAIL.""

THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED AND SURFACE CLEAN-UP STARTED.  THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS EXCAVATED AND A SPOT OF LOCALIZED CORROSION WAS FOUND TOP DEAD CENTER OF THE PIPE. THIS CORROSION AND RESULTING HOLE APPEARED TO BE AT THE LOCATION OF A CAD WELD FOR A POLARIZATION CELL LEAD.  THE COATING AT THIS LOCATION HAD BEEN REMOVED TO MAKE THE CAD WELD.  THE LINE WAS REPAIRED AND THE FAILED PORTION IS BEING SENT TO OUR LAB FOR FURTHER METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE CONCLUSIONS OF OUR CORROSION PERSONNEL AND METALURGISTS IS AS FOLLOWS:THE FAILED SECTION OF THE 30"" OIL LINE WAS SHOWN TO OUR METALLURGIST AT THE LAB AND HE SAID THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE NATURE OF THE CORROSION OF THE PIPE PRECLUDES A DEFINITIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FAILURE MODE, DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CORROSION PRESENT.  THE PRESENCE OF GENERAL CORROSION ON THE PIPE AND GROSS MATERIAL LOSS ESSENTIALLY PRECLUDES EXAMINING THE STEEL FOR CORROSION CAUSED BY A SPECIFIC EVENT, SUCH AS AC CURRENT ARCING AT THE FAILURE POINT (WHERE THE STUD FOR THE GROUNDING CABLE WAS LOCATED).      THUS WE ARE LEFT WITH PIECING THE FAILURE MODE TOGETHER BASED ON THE HISTORY.  OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORY IS:    H THE 30"" LINE WAS INSTALLED ABOUT 1976, WITH THE BURIED ISOLATION JOINT AT THE PORT OF PALM BEACH UTILIZING THREADED STEEL STUDS WELDED TO BOTH SIDES OF THE ISOLATION JOINT.  A ZINC / COPPER GROUNDING CELL WAS WIRED TO THE JOINT VIA THE STUDS.  CATHODIC PROTECTION (CP) WAS NOT PROVIDED FOR THE SHORT, ISOLATED SECTION OF THE LINE (EAST SIDE OF THE JOINT).    H IN 1980, A POLARIZATION CELL WAS INSTALLED ACROSS THE ISOLATION JOINT.  4/0 POLARIZATION CELL CABLES WERE CONNECTED TO THE LINE USING THE EXISTING STUDS AT THE ISOLATION JOINT.  COPPER COMPRESSION RING TERMINALS WERE USED FOR THESE CABLE CONNECTIONS.  NOTE THAT THE THERMAL INSULATION HAD TO BE REMOVED TO RETROFIT THESE CABLES; PROPER SEALING OF THE INSULATION AND JACKET MAY NOT HAVE OCCURRED ONCE THESE CABLES WERE RETROFITTED TO THE PIPES.    H WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE RIVIERA PLANT FUEL OIL STORAGE TANK CP SYSTEM IN 1997, THE ISOLATED SECTION OF THE 30"" LINE AT THE PORT OF PALM BEACH BEGAN RECEIVING CP, SINCE THIS SECTION OF THE LINE IS GROUNDED COMMON TO THE PLANT TANKS.    H IN DECEMBER 2003, THE 30"" LINE LEAKED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE ISOLATION JOINT.  UPON VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE LEAK, THE STEEL STUD HAD CORRODED AWAY, AND THE COMPRESSION RING TERMINAL OF THE 4/0 CABLE APPEARED TO HAVE EXPERIENCED ARCING (THE RING PART OF THE TERMINAL NO LONGER EXIST; ONLY THE CRIMP PORTION WAS REMAINING).  THE STUD & 4/0 CABLE CONNECTION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE JOINT WAS FOUND INTACT AND IN GOOD CONDITION.    GIVEN THE TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS, IT IS LIKELY THAT GENERAL CORROSION OF THE SHORT, ISOLATED SECTION OF THE LINE (EAST SIDE OF THE JOINT) PROCEEDED FOR ABOUT 21 YEARS (1976 TO 1997).  GENERAL CORROSION IS EVIDENT ON THE ISOLATED PART OF THE REMOVED SECTION OF PIPE.    SINCE THE ISOLATED SECTION OF LINE WAS NOT PROTECTED WITH CP DURING THIS TIME, A BIMETALLIC CORROSION CELL EXISTED BETWEEN THE STEEL STUD AND SURROUNDING PIPE, AND THE COPPER CABLE AND COPPER RING CONNECTOR, WITH THE STUD AND SURROUNDING STEEL PIPE BEING ANODIC (CORRODING) TO THE COPPER COMPONENTS.  VISUAL INSPECTION INDICATES THAT THE COATING AND THERMAL INSULATION AT THE LEAK LOCATION WAS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION, WHICH ALLOWED GROUNDWATER TO BE PRESENT AT THE STUD CONNECTION, AND ALLOWED THE BIMETALLIC CORROSION TO PROCEED.  THE 30"" POLARIZATION CELL AT THE PORT PASSES AC CURRENT BACK TO THE RIVIERA PLANT GROUND; AC EXISTS ON THE 30"" BECAUSE IT IS LOCATED IN THE TRANSMISSION RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND VOLTAGE IS INDUCED ON THE LINE FROM THE TRANSMISSION LINES.    IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE BIMETALLIC CORROSION CELL AT THE STEEL STUD EVENTUALLY DEGRADED THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTION AT THE STUD, RESULTING IN A HIGH RESISTANCE CONTACT.  CONSEQUENTLY THE AC CURRENT PA SSING THROUGH THIS CONNECTION EVENTUALLY BECAME AN ARCING CONDITION; THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE DAMAGE SEEN ON THE RING CONNECTOR.  THE ONGOING ARCING AC MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE PIPE CORROSION, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS CANNOT BE MEASURED DIRECTLY.  THE FACT THAT THE LINE LEAKED SOME SIX YEARS AFTER CP WAS APPLIED TO THE ISOLATED SECTION OF LINE FURTHER SUPPORTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT ARCING AC CURRENT AT THE STUD CONTRIBUTED TO THE CORROSION.    AS COUNTERMEASURES TO THIS EVENT, THESE INSULATORS THAT STILL EXIST WITHIN OUR SYSTEM ARE GIVEN SPECIAL ATTENTION WHEN IN-LINE INSPECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED FOR SIGNS OF METAL LOSS.  AN ILI WAS CONDUCTED ON THIS PIPELINE AFTER THE EVENT TO INSURE INTEGRITY GOING FORWARD.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS INSULATING FLANGE WAS MOVED ABOVE GROUND AND THE POLARIZATION CELL LEADS WERE CONNECTED WHERE THEY WERE EASILY INSPECTED VISUALLY."

THE RESULTS OF THE MOST CURRENT INSPECTION COMPLETED IN AUGUST '03 HAD NOT YET MADE IT INTO OUR HANDS.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCIDENT, WE TRACKED DOWN THE REPORT AND UPON EXAMINATION OF SAME FOUND THAT THE AREA OF THE LEAK HAD BEEN DESCRIBED ON THIS REPORT AS SERIOUS.  CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE FACTS INDICATE THAT THE INSPECTION COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN INCONSISTENT IN THE APPLICATION OF A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL IN THE CONDUCT OF INSPECTIONS AND COMPILATION OF REPORTS.

A ONE-FOT TIGHT-FITTING SLEEVE, PLACED OVER A RUBBER PATCH, WAS WELDED OVER THE DENT. DISOCVERY, EVALUATION AND REPAIR OF CRACK WAS ALL COMPLETED WITHIN 12 HOURS.   UPDATE 8/11/2004 - AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE GROUNDWATER DIRECTLY BELOW THE AREA OF THE LEAK WAS AFFECTED.  ADDITIONAL MONITORING WELLS MUST BE INSTALLED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION.  ONCE THE WELLS ARE INSTALLED AND MONITORED, A BETTER ESTIMATE OF VOLUME AND COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION CAN BE ESTABLISHED.    FOLLOWING THE INSTALLATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MONITORING WELL, APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT OF OIL WAS OBSERVED IN EARLY AUGUST 2004.  THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY WAS NOTIFIED OF THIS FINDING AT THAT TIME.  ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION WAS NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE OIL LOST AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACTS TO GROUNDWATER, WHICH TOOK SOME TIME DUE TO DIFFICULT SITE ACCESS, REQUIRED PERMITS, CHANGE IN LAND OWNERSHIP AND DIFFICULT DRILLING CONDITIONS (LARGE BOULDERS).  DRILLING BEGAN IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND CONTINUED THROUGH NOVEMBER UNTIL SNOWFALL RESTRICTED ACCESS.  ALL MONITORING WELLS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED AND SURVEYED.  THE INITIAL MONITORING EVENT WAS COMPLETED IN MID-DECEMBER AND A CONFIRMATORY SAMPLING EVENT WAS CONDUCTED IN LATE JANUARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INITIAL OBSERVATIONS WERE VALID AND THE OIL THICKNESSES OBSERVED IN THE WELLS HAD STABILIZED.  FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION OF THE DATA FROM THE LATE JANUARY SAMPLING EVENT, THE OIL LOST VOLUME WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CALCULATED BASED ON THE OBSERVED OIL THICKNESSES IN THE MONITORING WELLS AND REPORTED TO THE APPLICABLE AGENCIES INVOLVED."

THE MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP SEWER AUTHORITY INITIALLY DETECTED PETROLEUM ODORS IN A SANITARY SEWER AT THIS INTERSECTION.  SUNOCO PIPELINE INVESTIGATED THEIR PIPELINE AS THE SOURCE WHILE SEWER AUTHORITY AND LOCAL FIRE OFFICIALS ALSO INVESTIGATED OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES IN THE VICINITY.  UPON EXCAVATION OF THE PIPELINE AND CASING IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A RELEASE FROM THE PIPELINE.    APPARENTLY PRODUCT WAS LOST AT A LOW RATE OVER AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME BUT AT LEAST 1 DAY AND 19 HOURS IN DURATION BASED ON THE SEWER AUTHORITY NOTIFICATION OF ODORS UNTIL CONFIRMATION OF THE LEAK.  NO EVACUATIONS WERE NECESSARY AND A SMALL AREA AROUND THE CASING END WAS SECURED WITH TRAFFIC BARRIERS WHILE PIPELINE CREWS INVESTIGATED THE LEAK, MADE REPAIRS TO THE PIPELINE AND BEGAN CLEANING UP THE PRODUCT.  THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE FAILED SECTION WITH A 6-FOOT SECTION OF PRE-TESTED API 5LX 14-INCH X 0.375 WT X-52 LINE PIPE.  EXCAVATED SOILS WERE REMOVED FROM THE SITE FOR REMEDIATION AND DISPOSAL.  A REMEDIATION SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED IN THE REPAIR TRENCH PRIOR TO BACKFILLING THE REPAIRED PIPELINE AND CASING.  REMEDIATION IS ONGOING    THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON THE PIPE BODY BETWEEN THE 2:00 AND 3:00 OCLOCK ORIENTATION 10-INCHES IN FROM THE DOWNSTREAM END OF A 20-INCH DIAMETER CASING ACROSS ROUTE 1.  CC TECHNOLOGIES EXAMINED THE FAILED PIPE AND DETERMINED THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A CRACK LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF A LONGITUDINALLY ORIENTED, EXTERNAL METAL LOSS FEATURE APPROXIMATELY 3-INCHES LONG, 1-INCH WIDE WITH A DEPTH OF 89% OF PIPE WT.  A FAILURE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THE CRACK WAS MOST LIKELY PROPAGATED BY A FATIGUE MECHANISM, DRIVEN BY PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE PIPELINE."

THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AND WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITION.  WE DISPATCHED PERSONNEL TO BEGIN SURVEILLANCE OF THE PIPELINE BY DRIVING THE PIPELINE RIGHT-OF-WAY LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF A SPILL.  BY DARK, ON TUESDAY, APRIL 27, WE HAD NOT FOUND EVIDENCE OF A RELEASE.  THE DECISION WAS MADE TO POSTPONE SURVEILLANCE UNTIL DAYLIGHT THE NEXT DAY DUE TO THE PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS OF SPOTTING INDICATIONS OF A RELEASE AFTER DARK, CONCERNS FOR OUR EMPLOYEE'S SAFETY, AND THE FACT THAT THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN, THEREBY MINIMIZING ANY POTENTIAL FOR CONTINUING TO RELEASE PRODUCT FROM THE PIPELINE EVEN IF WE HAD A RELEASE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 0600, ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28, 2004 KINDER MORGAN PERSONNEL RESUMED PATROLLING THE PIPELINE FOR EVIDENCE OF A SPILL; ADDITIONALLY, WE BEGAN AERIAL SURVEILLANCE AT APPROXIMATELY 0745.

BY APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM, IT APPEARED LESS AND LESS AS IF THE ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITION WAS DUE TO A RELEASE.  HOWEVER, TO BE SURE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD PROCEDURES, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO APPLY MINIMAL PRESSURE TO THE PIPELINE TO ENSURE ITS INTEGRITY.  THIS WAS DONE BY USING SMALLER PUMPS THAN ARE NORMALLY USED FOR PIPELINE OPERATION. PRIOR TO CONDUCTING THE TEST, WE NOTIFIED THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE MARSHALS OFFICE TO INFORM THEM OF OUR PLANS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1240 PST, DURING THE ATTEMPTED RE-PRESSURING OF THE PIPELINE, KINDER MORGAN PERSONNEL REALIZED THAT THE PRESSURE WAS NOT INCREASING AS EXPECTED, AND THE PUMPS WERE IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN.  AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME, THE PILOT INFORMED GROUND PERSONNEL THAT HE SPOTTED A DISCOLORED AREA BETWEEN MILE POST 13 AND 15.  GROUND CREWS WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SUSPECTED SITE.  AT 1406 PST, KM FIELD EMPLOYEES NOTIFIED THE ORANGE CONTROL CENTER OF CONFIRMATION OF DISCOLORATION AND DETECTION OF DIESEL ODOR AT MILE POST 15.1.  NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE MADE IMMEDIATELY - WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF CONFIRMATION THAT WE HAD A SPILL (1418 & 1435 RESPECTIVELY)  SUBSEQUENTLY WE MADE CALLS TO THE CSFM LAKEWOOD OFFICE (APPROXIMATELY 14:36 PM) AND WESTERN REGION OF THE OPS (APPROXIMATELY 1450 PM).

THE OPERATOR CONTACTED OUR PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER TO HAVE THE LINE SHUT DOWN, THEN CONTACTED OUR DISTRICT OFFICE TO EFFECT A CLEANUP.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE LEAK SITE, THE LEAK WAS FOUND TO BE THE RESULT OF EXTERNAL CORROSION IN A 20-FEET EXPOSURE WHERE THE PIPELINE SPANNED ACROSS A SMALL CREEK WHICH SERVES AS THE RUN-OFF FROM A FOUR ACRE STOCK TANK THAT HAD BEEN BUILT IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE PIPELINE ROW.  IT IS SUSPECTED THAT OVER THE YEARS THE CONTINUED RUN-OFF FROM THE STOCK TANK HAS CAUSED THE SOIL TO ERODE ACROSS THE ROW WHICH EXPOSED THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE.  THERE WAS LOCALIZED PITTING WHERE THE PIPE COATING HAD BEEN DAMAGED.  THE LEAK OCCURRED AT THE TWO O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE PIPELINE AND WAS SPRAYING OIL UP INTO THE TREES ALONG THE ROW AND THEN RUNNING INTO THE CREEK.

PRELIMINARY METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS LIKELY AN ELECTRICAL ARCING CONDITION RESULTING FROM WHAT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT GROUND FAULT, I.E. TRANSMISSION OF POWER LINE VOLTAGE TO THE GROUND.  THE GROUND FAULT CREATED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN VOLTAGE BETWEEN THE PRODUCT SAMPLING LINE AND AN ADJACENT CONDUIT FITTING.  THE TRANSFER OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT VIA ARCING QUICKLY CAUSED A ""BURN-THROUGH"" CONDITION THAT RESULTED IN METAL LOSS TO THE SAMPLING LINE AND THE CREATION OF A SMALL PINHOLE.  GASOLINE SPRAYED FROM THE PINHOLE AND WAS MOST PROBABLY IGNITED IMMEDIATELY AS A RESULT OF THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE ARCING CONDITION.    THE SUSPECT GROUND FAULT OCCURRED WITHIN, OR VERY NEAR, THE POWER COMPANY'S ELECTRCAL SUBSTATION WHICH SUPPLIES POWER TO RENTON STATION AND IS PHYSICALLY SITUATED IN THE RENTON STATION YARD.  THIS ELECTRICAL ""EVENT"" IMMEDIATELY ENERGIZED THE ENTIRE GROUNDING SYSTEM AND RAPIDLY DISSIPATED THROUGH A NUMBER OF METAL STRUCTURES, DAMAGING ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AT THE RENTON STATION AND CAUSING THE RENTON STATION TO LOSE POWER.  PIPELINE OPERATIONS PRIOR TO THE ELECTRICAL EVENT WERE NORMAL IN ALL RESPECTS.    THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES CAUSED BY EITHER THE RELEASE OR ENSUING FIRE, ALTHOUGH THREE FIRE FIGHTERS WERE CONTAMINATED BY GASOLINE, TAKEN TO HARBORVIEW MEDICAL CENTER AND RELEASED.  NO OFF-SITE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE HAS BEEN DETECTED.  APPROXIMATELY 45 BARRELS OF GASOLINE WERE RELEASED FROM THE SAMPLING LINE, INCLUDING AN ESTIMATED 7 BARRELS THAT WERE BURNED OFF DURING THE FIRE, RESULTING IN ROUGHLY 38 BARRELS (LESS THAN 1600 GALLONS) OF GASOLINE RELEASED TO THE AIR OR TO THE GROUND.  APPROXIMATELY 20 BARRELS (840 GALLONS) HAVE BEEN RECOVERED, AND APPROXIMATELY 18 BARRELS (746 GALLONS) EITHER EVAPORATED OR REMAIN ON-SITE AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RECOVERED."

SOUTH BALTIMORE DELIVERY IS A REMOTE FACILITY SERVED VIA LINE 31 FROM DORSEY JUNCTION CONTROLLED BY THE ATLANTA CONTROL CENTER. DURING THE EVENING OF JUNE 11, 2004 THUNDERSTORMS PASSED THROUGH THE AREA AND CAUSED A TEMMPORARY POWER FAILURE.  THE POWER FAILURE CAUSED SEVERAL ALARMS, INCLUDING SHIPPER MAX TANK FILL WHICH INITIATED AN AUTOMATIC SHUT DOWN ON LINE 31 - DORSEY UNITS SHUT DOWN, SOUTH BALTIMORE TAKE-OFF VALVE CLOSED.  CONTROLLER CALLED OUT A LOCAL SENIOR OPERATOR TO INSPECT THE STATION PRIOR TO RESUMING OPERATIONS.  PRIOR TO SENIOR OPERATOR REACHING THE FACILITY, POWER WAS RESTORED AND THE CONTROLLER CLOSED THE SHIPPER DELIVERY VALVE.    UPON ARRIVAL AT THE FACILITY, THE SENIOR OPERATOR FOUND THE MANIFOLD THERMAL RELIEF SYSTEM RELIVING INTO THE SUMP, CAUSING THE SUMP TO OVERFLOW.  THE SENIOR OPERATOR OPENED THE SHIPPER VALVE TO RELIEVE MANIFOLD PRESSURE AND STOP THE FLOW INTO THE SUMP.  THE OVERFLOW WAS CAPTURED BY THE YARD DRAIN SYSTEM AND ENTERED THE FACILITY OIL/WATER SEPARATOR WHICH CONTAINED 16"" OF PRODUCT ON THE INLET SIDE.  NO PRODUCT WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE SEPARATOR.  DURING CLEAN UP EFFORTS, IT WAS DISCOVERED THE YARD DRAIN SYSTEM WAS NOT FLOWING PROPERLY INTO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATORS AND ALLOWED PRODUCT TO ACCUMULATE THROUGHOUT THE YARD DRAIN SYSTEM.  THE ENTIRE YARD DRAIN SYSTEM WAS EXCAVATED AND CONTAMINATED SOIL REMOVED AND PROPERLY STORED AND SEALED IN PLASTIC UNTIL APPROPRIATE DISPOSAL METHOD IS DETERMINED.    INVESTIGATION FOUND THE STATION TAKE-OFF VALVE HAD NOT FULLY CLOSED AND ALLOWED STATIC LINE PRESSURE TO ENTER THE MANIFOLD PIPING.  THE VOULUME WAS LOW AND DID NOT ACTIVATE THE MANIFOLD RELIEF SYSTEM, BUT DID CAUSE A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO RELIEVE INTO THE SUMP AT THE 145 PSI SETTING.  THE TAKE-OFF VALVE WAS CYCLED AND SEATED PROPERLY. AFTER TESTING THE VALVE AND INSPECTING ALL COMPONENTS THE LINE WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATIONS."

THE NEIGHBOR INDICATED THAT HE SMELLED PRODUCT AROUND AN AREA ADJACENT TO THE WOODBURY TANK FARM. AN OPERATOR AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICIAN INVESTIGATED THE AREA IN QUESTION. THEY NOTICED ODORS COMING FROM A DRAINAGE LINE THAT RUNS FROM THE REAR OF THE TANK FARM TOWARDS HILL SIDE ROAD. AN ODOR WAS PRESENT BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF A SHEEN ON THE WATER. THE TANK FARM AREA AROUND THIS ODOR WAS INVESTIGATED AND NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF A PROBLEM WERE FOUND.  BETWEEN DECEMBER AND MARCH, GROUND WATER SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM EXISTING COLONIAL MONITORING WELLS AND SEVERAL ROUNDS OF GEO-PROBE TEST WERE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE CONTAMINATION. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED SOME LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION ABOVE THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT GROUNDWATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND THAT TANK 1234 COULD BE A POSSIBLE SOURCE. ON APRIL 15,2004 TANK 1234 WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND PREPARED FOR CLEANING. ON APRIL 29TH, HMT CONDUCTED A HELIUM TEST ON THE TANKS FLOOR AND FOUND A POSSIBLE INDICATION IN A WELD ON A FLOOR PLATE. A MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION OF THE INDICATION DID NOT CONFIRM AN ANOMALY.

THE LEAK WAS FROM A FAILED GASKET FOR THE BOLTED COVER OF A 12-INCH WHEATLEY SWING-CHECK VALVE LOCATED BETWEEN THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE LINES OF PUMP UNIT THREE.  THE FACILITY OPERATOR THEN NOTIFIED THE REGION 1 OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WHO RESPONDED TO THE SCENE ALONG WITH OTHER PIPELINE MAINTENANCE AND HES PERSONNEL PLUS A DESIGNATED OSRO FOR THIS FACILITY.      INITIALLY THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE CONFINED ON THE PUMP STATION PROPERTY WITH ANY AND ALL FREE PRODUCT BEING COLLECTED VIA VAC TRUCK IN PUDDLES, ON THE STONES AND IN A SUBSURFACE FRENCH DRAIN SYSTEM LOCATED BENEATH THE PIPING MANIFOLD.  THIS DRAIN SYSTEM EMPTIES INTO THE FACILITY OIL/WATER SEPARATOR AND HAD COLLECTED THE LEAKED PRODUCT.  SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE LEAK OCCURRED, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR HAD A DAMAGED BAFFLE THAT ALLOWED PRODUCT TO ENTER A STORM WATER SEWER, AN UNNAMED TRIBUTARY AND COLLECT IN A MAN-MADE STORM WATER RETENTION POND LOCATED IN A NEARBY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.  POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL WERE ON-SCENE AND WENT DOOR TO DOOR OF THE NEARBY RESIDENCES.  NO EVACUATIONS WERE MADE.  ADDITIONAL OSRO PERSONNEL WERE CALLED TO THE SCENE TO COLLECT THE PRODUCT AND CLEAN THE STORM SEWERS, UNNAMED TRIBUTARY AND POND.  THE PRODUCT IN THE RETENTION POND RESULTED IN A FISH KILL.  AGENCY OFFICIALS INVOLVED INCLUDED LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL, GLOUCESTER COUNTY AND NJ DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.    RESULTS OF THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE ACCIDENT WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE FLANGE ASSEMBLY RESULTING IN OVER-COMPRESSION OF A PAPER/FIBER GASKET.  THE FLANGE ASSEMBLY THAT FAILED HAD BEEN REASSEMBLED ABOUT 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FAILURE WITHOUT SPECIFIC ASSEMBLY PROCEDURE AVAILABLE TO THE OPERATORS MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL.  AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, SUNOCO PIPELINE WILL ISSUE A BOLTED FLANGE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURE INCLUDING BASIC PRACTICES, MATERIAL REFERENCES AND TORQUE VALUES.  THE PROCEDURE WILL ALSO ADDRESS PROPER CALIBRATION OF TORQUE WRENCHES."

TANK 353 IS A 322,500 BARREL, 48 FOOT TALL BY 220 FOOT DIAMETER FIXED ROOF JET FUEL TANK THAT WAS LAST INTERNALLY INSPECTED IN JANUARY OF 2003. UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE AREA AROUND TANK 353 ON JULY 5, 2004, THE EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR WAS FROM JET FUEL SEEPING FROM BENEATH THE TANK FLOOR AND THE RING WALL OF TANK 353, AND WAS ACCUMULATING IN THE TANK DIKE. ON JULY 2, 2004, STATION GAUGES INDICATED 7 INCHES OF RAINFALL WITHIN A 24-HOUR PERIOD IN GLENPOOL, OKLAHOMA. DURING THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL, THE DIKE OUTFALL VALVE FOR TANK DIKE 353 COULD NOT BE OPENED TO DISCHARGE WATER FROM THE TANK DIKE SINCE THE OUTFALL POINT IS A LOCAL CREEK, AND CREEK LEVELS WERE AT FLOOD STAGE AND WERE ABOVE THE DIKE DISCHARGE POINT. WHEN THE CREEK LEVELS SUBSIDED TO ALLOW FOR THE DISCHARGE, THE WATER INSIDE THE TANK DIKE WAS DISCHARGED. HOWEVER, BEFORE THE WATER COULD BE DISCHARGED, APPROXIMATELY 15 INCHES OF WATER ACCUMULATED INSIDE THE TANK DIKE AND AROUND TANK 353, WHICH WAS EMPTY. THE EMPTY TANK RECEIVED A 103,049 BARREL BATCH OF JET FUEL ON JULY 4, 2004, AT 20:10 HOURS.  THE TANK FLOOR OF THE EMPTY JET FUEL TANK FLOATED ENOUGH DUE TO THE WATER LEVELS TO CAUSE A 3 INCHES CRACK IN THE TANK FLOOR WHERE THE VERTICAL SUPPORT BRACKET FOR THE VORTEX BREAKER IS WELDED TO THE FLOOR AROUND THE SINGLE SUCTION AND FILL LINE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK. THE TANK WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR INSPECTION, AND REPAIRS. THE PETROLEUM IMPACTED SOIL WAS REMOVED, AND SOIL TESTING HAS INDICATED THAT IMPACTED SOIL IN THE DIKE AREA HAS BEEN REMOVED.      PART C ORIGIN OF THE ACCIDENT - 5. MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE A. AND B: TANK 353 IS AN ATMOSPHERIC STORAGE TANK AND NOT A PRESSURE CONTAINING VESSEL.  THE ESTIMATED PRESSURE FOR PART C.5.A. WAS BASED ON HEAD PRESSURE OF PRODUCT IN THE TANK AT TIME OF ACCIDENT, AS WELL AS THE MOP FOR PART C.5.B WAS BASED ON A FULL TANK."

UPON INITIAL EXAMINATION, THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION.  IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK, THE PIPELINE WAS STARTED UP AT 80% OF THE OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  AFTER THE LEAK WAS PINPOINTED, THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN, AND THE ENTIRE 200 FOOT SECTION (CONTAINING THE SLEEVES) WAS REPLACED.  THE CUTOT SECTION HAS BEEN SENT TO A METALLURGICAL LAB FOR TESTING.  THE PIPELINE CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT 80% OF THE OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT UNTIL AFTER PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE TOOL RUN (EXPLAINED BELOW) HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND/OR IMMEDIATE REPAIRS HAVE BEEN MADE.

THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE AT THE LEVELLAND TAKE-OFF FROM THE ANTON PIPELINE.  THE LEVELLAND TAKE-OFF IS A STUB OUT ON THE MAINLINE WHICH UNTIL  RECENTLY CONSISTED OF A RISER TAKING IT ABOVE GROUND AND A MANUAL BLOCK VALVE WHICH WAS BLIND FLANGED ON THE DOWN STREAM SIDE.  PRESENTLY THERE IS A PROJECT UNDERWAY, WHICH WILL CREATE A NEW CO2 FLOOD IN THE LEVELLAND AREA.   THE PROJECT IS DESIGNATED AS THE LEVELLAND UNIT PHASE I CO2 PROJECT.  AS PART OF THIS PROJECT, THE LEVELLAND TAKE-OFF HAS BECOME THE SITE OF CO2 DELIVERY FROM THE ANTON PIPELINE TO THE LEVELLAND UNIT PHASE I CO2 PROJECT.  THE FLOOD PROJECT INCLUDES THE INSTALLATION OF A METER RUN AT THE LEVELLAND DELIVERY SITE. SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE PROJECT TEAM HAD TEMPORARILY INSTALLED A PIPING SPOOL APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET IN LENGTH TYING THE LEVELLAND TAKE-OFF BLOCK VALVE TO THE METER RUN.  THE INSTALLATION WAS TEMPORARY AND THE FLANGE BOLT NUTS WERE ONLY STARTED ON THE STUDS.  TO ALLOW THIS TEMPORARY INSTALLATION, IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE BLIND FLANGE BE REMOVED FROM THE TAKE-OFF BLOCK VALVE.  DURING THE DESIGN PHASE OF THE PROJECT, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE TAKE-OFF BLOCK VALVE WOULD BE AUTOMATED AND THAT AN ADDITIONAL BLOCK WOULD NOT BE INSTALLED. IN ORDER TO AUTOMATE THIS BLOCK VALVE, A MOTORIZED CONTROLLER HAD TO BE INSTALLED ON THE BLOCK VALVE, ELECTRICAL POWER HAD TO BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE VALVE, AND CONTROL WIRING AND A SATELLITE LINK  HAD TO BE INSTALLED.  SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT A SUNLAND RMT AUTOMATION TECHNICIAN HAD RAN WIRING FROM THE ELECTRICAL POWER SOURCE TO A BREAKER BOX AT THE VALVE LOCATION AND THEN FROM THE BREAKER BOX TO THE VALVE.  PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, A BRAVO PIPELINE OPERATOR RAN CONDUIT AND CONTROL WIRING FROM THE METERING BUILDING TO THE VALVE.  THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT THE BRAVO PIPELINE OPERATOR WENT TO THE LOCATION TO CONNECT THE CONTROL WIRING TO THE VALVE AND TO MAKE THE VALVE CONTROL FUNCTIONAL.  ONCE THE CONTROL WIRING WAS CONNECTED, IN ORDER TO CHECK VALVE ROTATION, THE PIPELINE OPERATOR TURNED ON THE POWER TO THE BLOCK VALVE AND PUSHED THE BUTTON TO OPEN THE VALVE.  THE VALVE PARTIALLY OPENED AND 9.5 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF CO2 WAS RELEASED AND VENTED.  PRESSURE ON THE ANTON CO2 PIPELINE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1800 PSIG.  THE PIPELINE OPERATOR PUSHED THE STOP BUTTON ON THE VALVE AND EVACUATED.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN WAS ACTIVATED AND PROPER NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE.  THE ANTON CO2 PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN.  PUBLIC ROADS WERE BLOCKED FOR APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE INDICATING THE PUBLIC WAS EVER PLACED IN DANGER.  LAW ENFORCEMENT REOPENED THE ROADS AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00PM.  PIPELINE PRESSURE DROPPED TO APPROXIMATELY 300 PSIG BY 5:30 PM AND THE TAKE-OFF VALVE WAS CLOSED."

THE TANK WAS DRAINED USING THE MAINLINE BOOSTER PUMP UNTIL LOSS OF SUCTION WHICH CAUSED THE INTRODUCTION OF AIR INTO THE 150# ANSI CLASS HEADER WITHIN WOOD RIVER STATION.  THIS PORTION OF STATION PIPING WAS IDLE OVERNIGHT.  THE NEXT MORNING UPON START UP AN ADIABATIC COMPRESSION IGNITION EVENT OCCURRED CAUSING THREE GASKETS TO FAIL SIMULTANEOUSLY, RELEASING SIX BARRELS OF GASOLINE ONTO THE WOOD RIVER STATION PROPERTY.  MAPL PERFORMED A TAPROOT @ INCIDENT INVESTIGATION UTILITIZING MAPL PERSONNEL AND A THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT.  THE INSPECTION RESULTS FORM THE THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT STATES THAT AN ADIABATIC COMPRESSION OCCURRED CAUSING THE DIESEL AND AIR MIXTURE WITHIN THE LINE TO IGNITE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSING THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE HEADER TO INCREASE RAPIDLY UNTIL THE GASKETS FAILED AND THE PRESSURE WAS ALLEVIATED.  WITH INPUT FROM THE GASKET MANUFACTURER THE INVESTIGATION TEAM ESTIMATED THAT THE PRESSURE COULD HAVE RISEN TO 1,200 PSI PRIOR TO THE GASKETS FAILING THUS ALLEVIATING THE PRESSURE.  THIS EVENT HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH WOOD RIVER HAD A PROPERLY SIZED RELIEF VALVE IN PLACE AND OPERATIONAL.  IN RESPONSE TO THE RELEASE MAPL CONTROLLED AND CLEANED UP THE RELEASED PRODUCT.  MAPL ALSO CONDUCTED AN INSPECTION OF THE HEADER THAT RESULTED IN A TOTAL OF SIX GASKETS BEING REPLACED.  A ONE HOUR, 100% MOP (275PSI) PROOF TEST WAS THEN CONDUCTED ON THE HEADER PRIOR TO RECOMMISSIONING.  THE PRELIMINARY INDICATIONS FROM THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION PROMPTED MAPL TO ISSUE A COMPANY WIDE OPERATIONAL SAFETY ALERT ON OCTOBER 5, 2004 TO ENSURE THAT THIS TYPE OF EVENT DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  MAPL HAS IMPLEMENTED NEW PROCEDURES THAT DO NOT ALLOW PULLING TANKS DOWN TO LOSS OF SUCTION, POSSIBLY INTRODUCING AIR INTO STATION PIPING WITHOUT A PRIOR APPROVED PLAN TO REMOVE THE AIR BEFORE START UP.  THE ALERT ALSO REQUIRES THAT USE OF MAPL COMMISSIONING, DECOMMISSIONING AND RECOMMISSIONING (CDR) PROCESS FOR ALL MAINTENANCE OR OPERATIONS THAT MAY INTRODUCE AIR INTO THE SYSTEM.  THESE NEW PROCEDURES ENSURE THE ELIMINATION OF AIR IN STATION PIPING TO AVOID RAPID COMPRESSION UPON START UP.      4/20/2010 UPDATED FOLLOWING QA/QC DATA QUALITY REVIEW.  HCA INFORMATION UPDATED RELEASE WAS NOT ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN AN HCA WHEN, IN FACT, IT OCCURRED IN A POPULATED AREA.  ALSO THE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN UPDATED A BIT TO ALLEVIATE ANY CONFUSTION.  THE CONFUSION MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF THE NARRATIVE  DISCUSSING THE IGNITION OF THE PRODUCT WHEN THE CHECK BOX FOR ""PRODUCT IGNITED"" IS NOT CHECKED.  THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT AN ADIBATIC COMPRESSION OCCURRED CAUSING THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE HEADER TO INCREASE RAPIDLY UNTIL THE GASKET FAILED AND THE PRESSURE ALLEVIATED.  THE INVESTIGATION REPORT DID SAY THAT THE ADIABATIC COMPRESSION CAUSED THE DIESEL AND AIR MIXTURE WITHIN THE LINE TO IGNITE.  HOWEVER, WITH AN ADIABATIC COMPRESSION, THERE IS NO TRANSFER OF HEAT.  THE DOT/PHMSA DEFINITION OF IGNITE IS THAT THE COMMODITY CAUGHT FIRE.  THERE WAS NOT A FIRE AND THERE WAS NO TRANSFER OF HEAT AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.  IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED WHETHER THIS FIT THE DEFINITION OF AN EXPLOSION, AND THE DETERMINATION WAS THAT THIS DID NOT MEET THAT DEFINITION EITHER.  EXPLODE MEANS THE RELEASE OF TRANSPORTED COMMODITY RESULTED IN A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT RELEASE OF ENERGY, WHETHER ACCOMPANIED BY A FIRE INVOLVING THE RELEASED COMMODITY OR NOT.  THE RELEASE OF THE TRANSPORTED PRODUCT DID NOT RESULT IN AN SUDDEN AND VIOLENT RELEASE OF ENERGY.  RATHER THE SUDDEN AND VIOLENT RELEASE OF ENERGY RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF A TRANSPORTED PRODUCT."

A RESIDENT OF BARNES FERRY RD NOTIFIED THE CONTRACTOR THAT THERE WAS A PIPELINE RUNNING UNDER THE ROAD.  THEY FOUND OUR CONTACT NUMBER ON A PIPELINE MARKER APPROXIMATELY 1000 FT AWAY.  I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL AT APPROXIMATELY 14:00 FROM SOUTHERN STATE ENTERPRISE STATING THEY HAD HIT A FUEL LINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 14:02 WE SHUT DOWN ROBINS LINE PUMP AND CLOSED ALL VALVES.  WE CALLED ROBINS AFB AT APPROX 14:05 AND TOLD THEM TO CLOSE OFF.  WE WENT TO SITE, VERIFIED HIT, AND NOTED DAMP DIRT AT BOTTOM OF PIT AT APPROX 14:20.  WENT 1000 YARDS AND CLOSED OFF BLOCK VALVE AT APPROX 14:30.  CALLED SOUTH EASG MANAGER APPROX 14:45 TO NOTIFY.  THEN CALLED FLORIDA ROCK TANK LINES TO EXCAVATE FUEL OUT OF PIPELINE AT APPROX 15:30.  I THEN CALLED EH&S MANAGER AT 16:00.  HE CALLED GAEPD AND NRC WHO WILL COPY OPS ON REPORT.  CHECKED WEATHER - CLEAN FOR 24 - 48 HRS.  I CALLED CITY MACON EMERGENCY MGMT AND THEY ASKED ME TO PAGE THE FIRE DEPT AT 16:30.  FIRE DEPT WAS CONTACTED BY PAGER BUT DID NOT RESPOND OR RETURN MESSAGE.  FLORIDA ROCK CAME IN AT APPROX 16:30 TO EXCAVATE PRODUCT OUT OF LINE.  AT APPROX 16:55 WES/KANEB ASKED THE FOREMAN OF SOUTHERN STATE IF HE HAD A LOCATE TICKET OR NUMBER AND HE COULD NOT COME UP WITH ONE.  THE TERMINAL OPERATOR INFORMED ME THAT QSR GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE, HAD SHOWN UP AT SITE AND INDICATED THE RELEASE LOOKED TO BE 25 GALLONS OF FUEL OR LESS.  I CALLED INDUSTRIAL HYDRO BLAST TO SET UP VAC-TRUCK IF NEEDED.  WILL BE ON STAND BY WAS NOT REQUIRED.  MOVED OUT APPROX 1600 GALLONS JP8 INTO TRUCK OUT OF LINE AT MACON TERMINAL WHICH EQUALS .826 GALLONS PER FOOT.. SHOUL CLEAN 1,937 FEET OF PIPE.  THE HIT IN THE LINE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FT NORTH FROM BLOCKED VALVE.  AT APPROX 15:00 UNCOVERED PIPE 3/4"" BIT IN THE SIDE, 9 TO 10 O'CLOCK POSITION OF OUR PIPE.  REMOVED BIT, BUT LOST NO FUEL, BECAUSE PIPE WAS FREE OF FUEL AT THIS POINT DUE TO PULLING FUEL BACK TO THE TERMINAL WITH TANKER AND PUMP.  CLEANED OFF PIPE AND PUT ON A FULL SEAL TEMPORARY CLAMP AT APPROX 19:15.  COVERED UP PIPE MARK SITE WITH FLAGS AND MARKING TAPE.  WENT BACK TO TERMINAL TO DOUBLE CHECK ALL VALVES AND CLOSED UP FOR THE DAY AT APPROX 23:00.  AT 6:00AM ON 12/2/04 REMOVED PRODUCT FROM FLORIDA ROCK TANK TRUCK, WITH QSR APPROVAL, BACK INTO TANK 550FT.  AFTER THIS, CALLED UTILITY PROTECTION CENTER TO SEE IFF A TICKET WAS CALLED IN.  TALKED WITH OCTAVIA AND SHE SEARCHED FROM NOV 4 TO DEC 2 2004 AND COULD NOT FIND A LOCATE TICKET FROM SOUTHERN STATE.  SHE INFORMED ME TO CALL PSC.  AT THIS TIME I CONTACTED THEM, RECEIVING VOICE MAIL, AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THEM TO CALL ME BACK DUE TO AN UNAUTHORIZED HIT BY A UTILITY CONTRACTOR WITHOUT A LOCATE TICKET.  AT 07:00 I CALLED BIBB COUNTY ENGINEERS AND TALKED WITH KEITH BRASWELL ON HOW TO HANDLE PUTTING GRIFFIN RD BACK INTO SERVICE ONCE REPAIRS WERE MADE.  SOUTHERN STATE ENTERPRISES, THE COMPANY THAT BORED INTO OUR 4"" PIPE, IS A SUB-CONTRACTOR OF ANSCO & ASSOC WHICH FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS A SUBCONTRACTOR FOR BELL SOUTH CO.  THE COST TO REPAIR THIS SECTION OF LINE AND CLEAN UP AND REMEDIATE AT THIS TIME IS ESTIMATED AT $27,000 (AS OF 12/5/04).  AS OF TODAY, 12/5/04 19:00 PIPE REPAIR IS COMPLETE."

METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONCLUSION:  THE LEAK IN THE PIPLINE OCCURRED AT A REGION OF EXTERNAL CORROSION THAT WAS LOCATED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION ON ONE SIDE OF THE STOPPLE FITTING.  THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE WALL PENETRATION EXHIBITED A UNIFORM, GENERAL ATTACK THAT PRODUCED SEVERE WALL THINNING.

THE LINE IS OPERATED WITH THE SEGMENT FORM FREEPORT TERMINAL TO JONES CREEK TERMINAL IN INTERMITTENT SERVICES AND THE SEGMENT FROM JONES CREEK TERMINAL TO SWEENY COMPLEX IN FULL-TIME SERVICE.  THE LEAK OCCURRED ON THE 5.8 MILE SEGMENT OF THIS LINE BETWEEN FREEPORT AND JONES CREEK TERMINAL.  THIS PART OF PIPELINE 24 WAS IDLED ON NOVEMBER 10TH.  THE AIR PATROL FLEW THE PIPELINE RIGHT-OF-WAY ON NOVEMBER 9TH OR 6 DAYS BEFORE THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY EVIDENCE OF OIL.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AT CONOCOPHILLIPS JONES CREEK TERMINAL DISCOVERED THE LEAK AT 5:00 PM NOVEMBER 15, 2004.  EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED FROM CONOCOPHILLIPS SWEENY COMPLEX.  THERE ARE TWO CRUDE OIL PIPELINES IN THE AREA WHERE THE LEAK OCCURRED - 12"" PL#4 AND 24"" PL#24. PIPELINE NO 4 WAS SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY IN ADDITION TO PIPELINE NO 24 WHICH WAS ALREADY IDLED.  PIPELINE #4 AND PIPELINE #24 WERE MANUALLY ISOLATED UTILIZING THE MAINLINE BLOCK VALVES CLOSEST TO THE LEAK POINT TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT TO RECOVER OIL.  OIL DID NOT REACH THE JONES CREEK.  OIL WAS DETECTED AT IS CLOSEST POINT APPROXIMATELY 100 YARDS FROM THE CREEK.  THE SOURCE OF THE CRUDE OIL LEAK WAS LOCATED THE FOLLOWING DAY THROUGH A PLANNED METHODOLOGY.  THE 12"" PIPELINE #4 WAS PRESSURED TO 150PSIG AND BLOCKED IN.  THE PRESSURE WAS MAINTAINED FOR 2 HOURS VERIFYING THAT #4 PIPELINE WAS NOT LEAKING.  PIPELINE NO 4 WAS THEN PUT BACK IN SERVICE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1:00 PM A LOCATION ON THE 24"" (PIPELINE NO. 24) WAS EXCAVATED WHERE SOME GRASS APPEARED TO BE BROWNER THAN IN THE SURROUNDING AREA.  OIL WAS DISCOVERED LEAKING FROM THE 24"" AT THIS LOCATION.  THE LEAK LOCATION WAS IMMEDIATELY PLUGGED.  A SCAB CLAMP WAS INSTALLED ON THE LINE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 PM THAT EVENING.  THE LEAK WAS NEAR A WELD AND POSSIBLY IN THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE.  THERE WAS INDICATION OF CORROSION UNDER THE COATING POSSIBLY DUE TO WATER ENTERING THROUGH DISBONDED COATING.  THE CP ON THIS LINE WAS MEASURED AT -1.3659 MV.  THE POSSIBLITY OF INTERNAL CORROSION AS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR HAS NOT BEEN ELIMINATED.  A FINAL REPORT IS ANTICIPATED IN EARLY JANUARY OF 2005.  THE PIPELINE WILL REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE AND CLAMPED UNTIL THE REPAIR IS MADE.  A SECTION OF PIPE WILL BE REMOVED FOR INSPECTION AND ANALYSIS AT THAT TIME."

THE PUMP WAS AN EARLY 1950S CAST IRON PUMP IN A LOW-PRESSURE SERVICE BETWEEN A BREAKOUT TANK AND A MAINLINE PUMP.  AS A RESULT, A RELEASE OF TRANSMIX OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 09:36 HOURS AND LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9 MINUTES.  THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED BY LOCAL MARKETING TERMINAL OPERATORS AT APPROXIMATELY 09:45 HOURS.  THEY NOTIFIED THE PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER AND THE PUMP WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN WHICH ISOLATED THE LEAKING PUMP BY CLOSING MOVS.      PRODUCT FLOWED AROUND THE TANK DIKE, UNDER THE FACILITY FENCE AND THEN ALONG A PUBLIC ROAD UNTIL IT ENTERED A TRIBUTARY OF THE ALLEGHENY RIVER THAT RUNS THROUGH THE TERMINAL.  PRODUCT NEVER REACHED THE ALLEGHENY RIVER.  CONTAINMENT AND RECOVERY EFFORTS BEGAN IMMEDIATELY.  A BOOM WAS PLACED AT THE RIVER END OF THE TRIBUTARY.  A CALL WAS PLACED TO 911 TO FACILITATE RESTRICTION OF TRAFFIC NEAR THE AREA OF THE RELEASE.  A CLEANUP CONTRACTOR WAS CALLED TO PROVIDE VACUUM TRUCKS, ROLL OFF BOXES AND TANK TRUCKS.  EXCAVATION OF SOIL WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 16 AND 17 ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE LINE AND UP TO THE PUMP PAD.    THE SOURCE OF THE STRESS ON THE PUMP WAS THE RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS: THE REPLACEMENT OF NEARBY PIPE SUPPORTS, MODIFICATION OF CONCRETE WALLS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THE PUMP SUCTION AND DISCHARGE PIPING, GROUND HEAVE AS A RESULT OF THE RECORD RAINFALL THIS YEAR AND THE SUDDEN BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURES ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT.  THE PIPE SUPPORT REPLACEMENT AND THE MODIFICATION OF THE CONCRETE WALLS WERE PERFORMED IN MID-2004 TO MEET THE NEW DOT 195 REQUIREMENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION INSPECTION UNDER PIPE SUPPORTS AND THROUGH WALL PENETRATIONS.    AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT, THE COMPANY WILL DEVELOP PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING AND WORKING WITH CAST IRON COMPONENTS AND PROVIDE TRAINING FOR FIELD PERSONNEL.  THE EXISTING MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE PROCESS WILL ALSO BE REVIEWED FOR INCLUSION OF WORK ACTIVITIES RESULTING FROM ROLL OUT OF NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS."

THE CC OPERATOR SHUT DOWN THE SEGMENT AND ISOLATED IT BY CLOSING REMOTE OPERATED BLOCK VALVES AT WOONSOCKET STATION AND WOLSEY TERMINAL.

IN ADDITION, KANEB DISPATCHED A PLANE TO CONDUCT AN AERIAL PATROL OF THE RIGHT OF WAY BETWEEN WOONSOCKET STATION AND WOLSEY TERMINAL.  NO EVIDENCE OF A RELEASE WAS FOUND AND THE SEARCH WAS HALTED AT DUSK DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS.  KANEB PERSONNEL NOTIFIED SEVERAL RESIDENCES ALONG THE RIGHT OF WAY OF A POSSIBLE RELEASE, AND PROVIDED CONTACT INFORMATION TO THEM.

IT CAN SOURCE PRODUCT FROM THE SUNOCO EAGLE POINT AND GIRARD POINT REFINERIES ALONG WITH CONOCO PHILLIPS REFINERY. ON JANUARY 28, AT APPROXIMATELY 0515 HOURS, THE ON-DUTY STATION OPERATOR AT WOODBURY RECEIVED A HIGH TANK ALARM FOR PRESSURE RELIEF TANK NUMBER 4590, WHICH SERVES AS A SURGE RELIEF TANK FOR ALL INCOMING PIPELINES.  AT THE TIME OF THIS ALARM, THE INCOMING 16-INCH PIPELINE FROM EAGLE POINT REFINERY WAS DELIVERING GASOLINE.  THE GAUGE LEVEL FOR THIS TANK INDICATED ONLY 6 BARRELS IN THE TANK (CAPACITY IS 1600 BARRELS), THE INCOMING OPERATING PRESSURE WAS LOWER THAN THE PRESSURE RELIEF SETTING AND THE SURGE RELIEF VALVE INDICATED CLOSED.  THE OPERATOR WENT TO THE TANK TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE REASON FOR THE ALARM BECAUSE ALL OPERATING DATA SHOWED NO PRODUCT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTERING THE TANK.  WHEN THE TANK SIDE GAUGE DEVICE WAS BUMPED, THE GAUGE SPUN PROVIDING A GAUGE READING FOR A FULL TANK.  BEFORE THE OPERATOR COULD START TO TRANSFER PRODUCT FROM THE RELIEF TANK, PRODUCT STARTED OVERFLOWING FROM THE TANK VENT.  AT THIS POINT, ALL INCOMING PIPELINES INTO WOODBURY WERE SHUT DOWN QUICKLY THEREBY STOPPING THE TANK OVERFLOW.  THE MAIN OUTGOING PIPELINE WAS ALSO SHUT DOWN JUST TO BE SAFE.    APPROXIMATELY 250 GALLONS OF GASOLINE OVERFLOWED FROM THE TANK.  ALL SPILLED PRODUCT WAS CAPTURED IN THE TANK DIKE.  PRODUCT AND CONTAMINATED ICE AND SNOW WERE CLEANED UP UTILIZING A VACUUM TRUCK AND DRUMS.  CONTAMINATED SOILS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE SURFACE AND REMEDIATED.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT INDICATED 3 SEPARATE EQUIPMENT FAILURES.  THE PILOT CONTROLLED RELIEF VALVE OPENED DURING AN OPERATIONAL BACK-PRESSURE EVENT SEVERAL HOURS PRIOR TO THE TANK OVERFLOW AND APPARENTLY DID NOT FULLY RESEAT.  THIS ALLOWED PRODUCT TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER INTO THE RELIEF TANK.  A SECOND EQUIPMENT FAILURE INVOLVED THE RELIEF VALVE ACTIVATION ALARM MICRO SWITCH.  THIS DEVICE WAS FROZEN OPEN AND DID NOT ALERT THE OPERATOR TO THE FACT THAT THE RELIEF VALVE HAD OPENED.  THE THIRD DEVICE TO NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WAS THE TANK SIDE-GAUGER THAT HAD THE STEEL TAPE FROZEN, THEREBY NOT INDICATING ANY CHANGE IN TANK VOLUME.  A FOURTH DEVICE, AN INDEPENDENT ROOF TOP ALARM PROVIDED THE ONLY ALARM TO THE OPERATOR."

THE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOIL SUBSIDENCE WHICH WAS CAUSED BY HIGH WATER.  THE SOIL SUBSIDENCE EXERTED FORCE ON THE WELD, CAUSING IT TO CRACK.  FAILED SECTION OF PIPE HAS BEEN SENT TO CC TECHNOLOGIES FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE OPS FAILURE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL IS BEING USED BY CC TECHNOLOGIES.  LEAK VOLUMES ARE STILL ESTIMATES SUBJECT TO UPWARD REVISION.   5-11-05 THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE WAS TAKEN BY CC TECHNOLOGIES (CCT) TO THEIR FACILITY FOR A FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE RESULT OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF A THROUGH-WALL CRACK IN THE 22"" GIRTH WELD.  THE CRACK EXTENDED FOR 2:30 TO THE 8:00 ORIENTATION, LOOKING DOWNSTREAM, ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE.  CCT CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE THREE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE PIPELINE FAILURE AS FOLLOWS: ""IN CONCLUSION, THE THREE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE PIPELINE FAILURE WERE A BENDING STRESS ON THE PIPE CAUSED BY SEVERE FLOODING OF THE NEARBY KENTUCKY RIVER, A POOR QUALITY GIRTH WELD EXHIBITED BY POROSITY AND OR INCLUSIONS IN THE WELD AS WELL AS SECONDARY CRACKS AT THE WELD BASE, AND AN OFFSET BETWEEN THE TWO SECTIONS JOINED BY THE FAILED GIRTH WELD."" CCT ALSO POINTS OUT THAT ""THE WELD QUALITY IS TYPICAL FOR THIS PIPE VINTAGE AND WOULD NOT HAVE POSED A PROBLEM IN THE ABSENCE OF OUTSIDE BENDING FORCES."""

THE TANK OVERFILLED AND APPROXIMATLEY 5 BBLS OF CRUDE SPILLED ONTO THE GROUND.  INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THAT THE PRIMARY HIGH LEVEL TRANSMITTER FOR THE TANK DID NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED ALLOWING THE FLOW TO CONTINUE INTO THE TANK.  WE FOUND FIELD WIRING WRAPPED AROUND THE MECHANICAL LINKAGE INSIDE THE INSTRUMENT'S ENCLOSURE THUS JAMMING THE TRANSMITTER.  THE SECONDARY TANK HIGH LIQUID LEVEL DEVISE ALSO DID NOT PROVIDE THE INTENDED SHUTDOWN DUE TO A BLOWN FUSE.  PRESENTLY, ALL ASSOCIATED MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL AND LOGIC ISSUES WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THESE LEVEL DEVICES HAVE BEEN CORRECTED. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED AND PLACED BACK INTO OPERATIONS."

IT IS THEORIZED THAT CLOSURE OF THIS DOWNSTREAM VALVE, SUBJECTED THE CHECK VALVE, AND 4' SEGMENT OF PIPE TO THERMAL PRESSURE BUILD-UP.  THIS THERMAL PRESSURE CAUSED THE O-RING IN THE CHECK VALVE TO FAIL, AND THE RELEASE WAS THEN FUELED BY THE DISCHARGE OF THE STATION BOOSTER PUMP.  NOTE: ON PART C, NUMBER 5(A) ""ESTIMATED PRESSURE AT POINT AND TIME OF ACCIDENT"" IS BEING REPORTED AS 1400 PSI.  THIS PRESSURE WAS NOT RECORDED BUT IS DERIVED FROM A CALCULATION BASED ON WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED, GIVEN THAT CLOSURE OF THE VALVE COULD HAVE BLOCKED IN AN APPROXIMATE 4-FOOT SECTION OF PIPE, ALONG WITH THE CHECK VALVE, IF, THE VALVE AND CHECK PROPERLY SEALED.  THE 1400 PSI ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON A 19 DEGREE RISE IN TEMPERATURE OF MEDIUM BLOCKED IN THE CHECK VALVE AND SEGMENT OF PIPE.     4/20/2010 - UPDATED FOLLOWING QA/QC DATA QUALITY REVIEW.

A 10.67 FOOT LONG SECTION OF THE 24 INCH PIPE CONTAINING THE THROUGH WALL FLAW AND UPSTREAM REFERENCE GIRTH WELD WAS REMOVED, COVERED WITH PLASTIC WRAP AND SENT TO CC TECHNOLOGIES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  THE PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS WAS TO DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WERE OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.  THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED A LEAK EMANATED FROM A PRE-EXISTING THROUGH WALL DEFECT LOCATED AT THE FUSION LINE OF THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM WELD.  THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE DEFECT IS CONSISTENT WITH LACK OF FUSION AT THE BOND LINE OF THE ERW.  THE ESTIMATED LEAK DURATION IS LISTED AS 0 AS THE DURATION IS NOT KNOWN. THE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND REMEDIATION OF SUBSURFACE WATER IS ONGOING. ZERO BARRELS ARE NOTED ON AMOUNT IN WATER AS THE CONCENTRATIONS ARE IN THE PARTS PER MILLION RANGE.  THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY THAT HAS OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT HAS YET TO PROVIDE CLOSURE OF THE REMEDIATION PROJECT. HOWEVER, PHMSA HAS REQUESTED A CLOSURE REPORT.

(SPLP) CONTROL CENTER RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE SCIPIO-REPUBLIC FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT THERE WAS FIRE AT ONE OF OUR PIPELINE STATIONS NEAR REPUBLIC, OH.  THE PIPELINE IN THE AREA WAS NOT RUNNING AT THE TIME BUT HAD A STATIC PRESSURE OF ABOUT 300 PSI.  THE CONTROL CENTER CONFIRMED THE REPORTED FIRE LOCATION AS BEING AT THE OUT-OF-SERVICE LOWELL PUMP STATION.  AT 0655 HOURS, THE AREA SUPERVISOR WAS NOTIFIED AT HOME AND BEGAN RESPONDING TO THE SCENE.  AT 0656 HOURS CONTROL CENTER OPENED INTO HUDSON TANK FARM TO DRAIN PRESSURE FROM THE PIPELINE AND AT 0658 HOURS, A DOWNSTREAM PUMP STATION WAS STARTED TO PULL PRODUCT AWAY FROM THE LOCATION OF THE FIRE.  AT 0659 HOURS, THE DOWNSTREAM PUMP STATION WENT DOWN ON LOW SUCTION AND THE MAIN LINE VALVES AT LOWELL WERE CLOSED.    AT 0705 HOURS, THE RESPONDING SPLP SUPERVISOR, CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE ON SCENE TO ESTABLISH CONTACT.  FROM THIS CONVERSATION, THE SPLP SUPERVISOR WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE FUEL SOURCE OF THE FIRE WAS STAINLESS STEEL INSTRUMENT TUBING.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS THEN ADVISED OF THE LOCATION OF A 1/2"" VALVE THAT COULD BE CLOSED TO SHUTOFF THE PRODUCT SUPPLYING THE FIRE.  THIS VALVE WAS SHUT BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE FIRE BURNED OUT.  AT 0725 HOURS, THE SPLP SUPERVISOR ARRIVED ON-SITE, MET WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, MONITORED THE ATMOSPHERE AND DETERMINED THE AREA TO BE SAFE.    UPON INVESTIGATION IT WAS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A BAND OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA AT THE TIME THE FIRE OCCURRED AND THAT A BOLT OF LIGHTNING HAD STRUCK NEAR THE STATION BURNING A HOLE THROUGH  INCH TUBING RELEASING AND IGNITING GASOLINE.  LOWELL PUMP STATION IS CURRENTLY IN A DECOMMISSIONED STATE WITH THE STATION PIPING PURGED AND ISOLATED FROM THE MAIN PIPELINE.  THE LOCATION IS STILL UTILIZED AS A MAIN LINE PRESSURE DATA POINT FOR THE CPM LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM.  INVESTIGATION OF SCADA DATA INDICATED THAT THE LINE STARTED LOSING PRESSURE AT 0633 HOURS.  EXAMINATION OF THE PIPELINE FOUND A LIGHTNING DIFFUSER ON AN INSULATING JOINT WITH A SHATTERED DISC ALLOWING CURRENT FROM THE LIGHTNING STRIKE TO TRAVEL DOWN THE ABOVE GROUND MAIN LINE PIPING AND ONTO THE TUBING WHERE IT GROUNDED TO A NEARBY PIPE SUPPORT. THE ENTIRE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONSUMED BY THE FIRE AND WAS CALCULATED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 90 GALLONS."

THE DCTF ALSO SUPPLIES CRUDE OIL DIRECTLY TO THE SUNOCO GIRARD POINT REFINERY 137 PROCESSING UNIT VIA A SINGLE 16-INCH PIPELINE.  DCTF CURRENTLY HAS 25 TANKS IN SERVICE WITH APPROXIMATELY HALF TIED INTO THE S SHIP LINE MANIFOLD (SSL) AND HALF INTO THE N SHIP LINE MANIFOLD (NSL).  DCTF IS A MANNED FACILITY WITH TWO OPERATORS ON DUTY WORKING 12 HOUR SHIFTS, 24/7.  ON NOV. 22, TANK NUMBER 24 (#24) WAS BEING FILLED FROM THE SSL AND WAS FILLED TO SAFE FILL CAPACITY AT 1000HOURS.  AT THAT TIME THE DAY SHIFT OPERATORS SWITCHED THE DELIVERY TO #35 ON THE NSL.  FLOW TO #24 WAS STOPPED BY CLOSING THE CENTRAL MANIFOLD BLOCK VALVE ON THE SSL.  THE STREET VALVE LOCATED BETWEEN THE SSL AND #24 SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN CLOSED BY THE OPERATOR BUT WAS NOT.  DCTF OPERATORS CHANGED SHIFT AT 1700 HOURS WITH #35 STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FILLED.  AT 2225 HOURS, THE CRUDE DELIVERY WAS SWITCHED FROM #35 ON THE NSL TO #3 ON THE SSL.  SINCE THE STREET VALVE TO #24 WAS LEFT OPEN EARLIER IN THE DAY, THE SSL NOW HAD BOTH #3 AND #24 TANKS ON LINE.  SEVERAL ALARMS FOR TANK HIGH LEVEL IN TANK #24 WERE RECEIVED BY THE NIGHT SHIFT OPERATORS BUT NOT ACTED ON BECAUSE THE OPERATOR BELIEVED THAT THE TANK WAS OFF LINE.  AT 0205 HOURS ON NOV. 23 THE OPERATORS RECEIVED A SEPARATE OPERATIONAL ALARM ON THE SAME ALARM PANEL WHERE THE DC24 HI-HI LEVEL ALARM IS LOCATED.  THE OPERATORS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS SEPARATE ALARM AND THEN DISCOVERED CRUDE OIL OVERFILLING #24 AND INTO THE TANK DIKE.  THE OPERATORS IMMEDIATELY TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO STOP FLOW INTO #24 BY CLOSING THE STREET VALVE.  THE SHIP UNLOADING WAS STOPPED A SHORT TIME LATER.  ALL OF THE SPILLED CRUDE OIL WAS CONTAINED BY THE TANK DIKE SYSTEM AND 99% WAS PUMPED BACK INTO ANOTHER TANK FOR NORMAL REFINERY PROCESSING.  DAMAGE TO #24 WAS LIMITED TO A MAN PLATFORM, SECONDARY SEAL, TANK GAUGING AND HIGH ALARM EQUIPMENT.  THE TANK HAS BEEN EMPTIED OF CRUDE OIL BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN RETURNED TO SERVICE PENDING COMPLETION OF REPAIR WORK.   A TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO OPS ON NOV. 23 AT 0800 HOURS."

EPOLP PROMPTLY SHUTDOWN THE LINE, NOTIFIED LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE, AND BEGAN VENTING PRODUCT FOR EXCAVATION & REPAIR. ONE RAILROAD AND SEVERAL LOCAL GRAVEL ROADS WERE BLOCKED UNTIL AREA MADE SAFE. AN ESTIMATED 3113 BBLS WAS SPILLED PRIOR TO ISOLATING THE LINE. AN ADDITIONAL 6550 BBLS WERE BLOWN DOWN UNDER CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE VENTING. THE PIPE HAD A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK ALONG THE FILLET WELD ON A TYPE B SLEEVE INSTALLED IN 1995. THE SLEEVE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE. OPS REP DAVID BARRETT WAS ON SITE DURING BLOWDOWN AND EXCAVATION. THE FAILED PIPE WAS SUBMITTED TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE LINE WAS PUT BACK INTO SERVICE UNDER A REDUCED CONTROL SET POINT OF 959 PSIG AT THE UPSTREAM KEARNEY PUMP STATION. THE PRESSURE AT THE NEAREST UPSTREAM CONTROL POINT, AT KEARNEY STATION, WAS 1066 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE LEAK. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION PIPELINE FLOW AND ELEVATION, THE ESTIMATED PRESSURE AT THE POINT AND TIME OF THE LEAK WAS 610 PSIG.    THE KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY STRESS CORROSION CRACKING AND FURTHER CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIALLY-ORIENTED CRACK WAS INFLUENCED BY EXTERNAL FORCES ON THE PIPELINE AND HAD LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, TO DO WITH THE LEVEL OF INTERNAL PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE.  WITH THIS INFORMATION, THE PRESSURE CONTROL AT THE KEARNEY STATION WAS RESET TO THE PRE-LEAK SET POINT.    PAGE 1 - SECTION 5 (LOSSES): OPERATOR PROPERTY DAMAGE IS REPAIR COSTS - LABOR & MATERIALS; VOLUME LOST AS RESULTS OF LEAK = 3113 BBLS AT A VALUE OF $104,366; VOLUME LOST AS RESULTS OF CONTROLLED BLOWDOWN = 6550 AT A VALUE OF $219,595."

AFTER PLAINS WAS CONTACTED, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RELEASE ORIGINATED IN ABOVE GROUND PIPING AT THE PLAINS BASIN ODESSA STATION WHICH WAS NOT IN OPERATION AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE.  PRESSURE WAS ON THIS SECTION OF PIPE FROM ANOTHER STATION OPERATING NEARBY.   INITIAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE ESTIMATED COST WOULD BE LESS THAN $50,000.  SUBSEQUENTLY, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE CONTAMINATED SOIL AREA IS LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE AND ALSO COSTS ARE RUNNING HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DUE TO ALL THE HAND DIGGING THAT IS REQUIRED TO REMOVE CONTAMINATED SOIL UNDER AND AROUND THE STATION PIPING AND CONDUITS.  THE FINAL COST OF THE RELEASE IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $64,170."

ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES, THE TANK CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY 118,000 BARRELS OF REGULAR GASOLINE (87 OCTANE) WHEN THE FIRE BEGAN. THE FIRE WAS MINIMIZED BY DRAINING THE TANK CONTENTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, FACTORING IN FIREFIGHTING CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS PUMPING CAPACITY AND GRAVITY FEED RATES.     THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE SIDEWALLS OF THE TANK WERE MAINTAINED SUCH THAT THERE WAS NO RELEASE OF GASOLINE TO BE ABSORBED INTO THE GROUND. THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT WATER AND FIRE FIGHTING LIQUIDS RECOVERED HAVE NO PETROLEUM SHEEN.     A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 24,319 BARRELS OF GASOLINE WERE BURNED IN THE FIRE OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 10.5 HOURS.    TANK 373 WAS AN INTERNAL FLOATING ROOF TANK WITH DUAL VAPOR WIPER SEALS.

A WIRELINE SERVICE DRIVER OBSERVED A VAPOR CLOUD AND CALLED 911 AT ABOUT 6:30 AM (MOUNTAIN TIME) ON 06/23/06.  THE EUNICE FIRE CHIEF AND A NEW MEXICO STATE POLICE OFFICER WERE ON SITE BUT LEFT THE SCENE BEFORE 10:00 AM (MOUNTAIN TIME).  ENTERPRISE, UNDER CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES, LOWERED THE LINE PRESSURE TO ZERO GUAGE PRESSURE BY FLARING PROPANE AT THE HOBBS STATION FLARE AND FLARING ADDITIONAL PRODUCT THROUGH A PORTABLE FLARE SET AT THE FIRST BLOCK VALVE NORTH OF THE LEAK SITE.  INITIALLY, THE PLAN WAS TO ISOLATE THE LEAK SEGMENT AT THE NEAREST BLOCK VALVE BUT THEN IT WAS DECIDED TO TAKE THE COMPLETE LINE OUT OF SERVICE BY PURGING THE LINE WITH NITROGEN.  SEPARATE NRC TELEPHONIC REPORTS WERE MADE TO REPORT THE PRODUCT FLARED AT THE SEPARATE  FLARE SITES.  CASE NUMBER 801759 REPORTED THE PRODUCT FLARED THROUGH THE PORTABLE FLARE NEAREST THE LEAK SITE, AND CASE NUMBER 801836 REPORTED THE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT FLARED AT HOBBS STATION NEAR SEMINOLE, TEXAS FOR TAKING THE LINE OUT OF SERVICE.  DURING THE FLARING PROCESS, FOUR ADDITIONAL MUCH SMALLER LEAKS WERE ALSO DISCOVERED ON THIS LINE.      ALL LEAKS HAVE BEEN REPAIRED AND THE LINE HAS BEEN HYDROTESTED.  THE LINE WILL BE RETURNED TO SERVICE AT A LATER DATE PENDING COMMERCIAL NEED FOR PRODUCT DELIVERIES TO CUSTOMERS.      EXCAVATION OF THE PRIMARY LEAK SITE REVEALED THAT THE LEAK WAS IN THE BODY OF THE PIPE AT THE 1:00 POSITION AT A HOLE OF ABOUT 3/8 DIAMETER INSIDE A CORROSION PIT.   IT APPEARS THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY A SHIELDED MOISTURE CELL UNDER DISBONDED TAPE WRAP.     THE COST OF PRODUCT LOST SHOWN IN THIS REPORT INCLUDES THE VOLUMES FLARED AT BOTH FLARE SITES WHEREAS THE SPILLED VOLUME REPORTED ON LINE 6 A. UNDER PART A IS THE TOTAL PRODUCT VOLUME THAT WAS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED UNCONTROLLED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS A RESULT OF THE LEAK.

THE NEW FILLET WELDS WERE INSPECTED WITH MAG PARTICLE ON JULY 30.  ON JULY 31, MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL SET THE STOPPLE, BLEW DOWN PRODUCT INTO A NURSE TANK, CUT OUT THE OLD SPLIT TEE AND TOR FITTING AND REPLACED THE CUT OUT WITH 5 FEET OF NEW 6.625"" OD, 0.156"" WT, X-46 ERW PIPE.  THE 2 TIE-IN WELDS WERE THEN X-RAYED; THE PIPE WAS SAND BLASTED AND TAPED WITH RD-6; THE SPLIT TEE WAS COATED WITH MASTIC.  LASTLY, THE LINE WAS FILLED WITH PRODUCT, THE STOPPLE PLUG WAS PULLED, THE EXCAVATED SITE WAS BACKFILLED, AND OPERATION OF THE LINE WAS RETURNED TO OPERATION CONTROL.    THE LEAK OCCURRED AT A WELD HIGH/LOW AREA WHERE THE INITIAL STOPPLE FILLET WELD WAS OF POOR QUALITY AND SUBJECTED TO EXTERNAL CORROSION. THE MATERIAL COVERING THE FAILED AREA WAS SENT TO HOUSTON FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.  THE EVALUATION CONFIRMED THAT THE CAUSE WAS A POOR WELD.

A CPL MAINTENANCE CREW ARRIVED AT THE SITE TO PERFORM WORK, SUPPORTING THE ETHYLENE SYSTEM PIM PROJECT. THE SYSTEM WAS ACTIVE, OPERATING AT A NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE OF 1200 PSIG. THE SCOPE OF WORK INCLUDED THE REMOVAL OF A 16 BLIND FLANGE, AND INSTALLATION OF A 16 GATE VALVE. THE GATE VALVE INSTALLATION WAS REQUIRED FOR THE REMOVAL OF A T. D. WILLIAMSON LOCK-O-RING PLUG THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN OCTOBER, 2001.

WHILE REMOVING THE BOLTS, ETHYLENE GAS BEGAN ESCAPING BETWEEN THE FLANGES.    IT IS SUSPECTED THAT WHILE VENTING THE PRESSURE DOWNSTREAM OF THE LOCK-O-RING PLUG, A 1200 PSI DELTA ACROSS THE PLUG FORCED THE PLUG AGAINST THE BLIND FLANGE. THE POSITION OF THE PLUG LIKELY SEALED THE BLEEDER PORT, FALSELY INDICATING NO PRESSURE BEHIND THE BLIND. ALSO, IT IS SUSPECTED THAT WHILE THE PLUG WAS FORCED AGAINST THE BLIND FLANGE, THE PLUGS O-RING ENTERED THE RING SEGMENT GROOVE. ENTERING THE RING SEGMENT GROOVE LIKELY CAUSED DAMAGED TO THE O-RING, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO ESCAPE WHEN THE BOLTS TO THE BLIND FLANGE WERE LOOSENED."

APPROXIMATELY 1400 BARRELS OF PROPANE WERE FLARED AND THE REMAINING 1740 BARRELS WERE VENTED.    THE ORIGINAL PIPE UNDER THE CANAL WAS ABANDONED IN PLACE AND REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE. THE 2005 ILI RUN DID INDICATE A METAL LOSS FEATURE (36% WALL LOSS)WITHIN THE CANAL CROSSING (ENGINEERING STATION 114+78); HOWEVER, THE FEATURE DID NOT MEET REPAIR CRITERIA AND THEREFORE WAS NOT INVESTIGATED FURTHER.    AN IRIS ULTRASONIC C-SCAN WAS RUN MARCH 5-9, 2007 ON THE ABANDONED SEGMENT THAT LEAKED. A CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD WAS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INCOMPLETE ROOT PASS AND INCOMPLETE CAP PASS OVER 30% OF THE PIPE CIRCUMFERENCE.

AT 08:50, THE CONTROL CENTER LEADER INFORMED THE DISTRICT LEADER WHO SUBSEQUENTLY NOTIFIED THE OPERATIONS MANAGER.  AT  09:03, OPERATIONS MANAGER SENT OUT 2 NASHVILLE SENIOR OPERATORS AND 2 TECHNICIANS TO INVESTIGATE.  THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER MADE NOTIFICATION TO NASHVILLE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND DISPATCHED LOCAL OSROS TO THE SITE TO ASSIST IN RESPONSE AND CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES.    AT 09:26,  SENIOR OPERATOR ARRIVED ON SITE AND CONFIRMED THAT DIESEL FUEL WAS LEAKING FROM LINE 20.  THE BULLDOZER OPERATOR THAT HAD STRUCK THE LINE WAS BUILDING A DIRT BERM TO CONTAIN THE PRODUCT.  THE SENIOR OPERATOR DIRECTED THE OPERATOR TO BUILD AN ADDITIONAL BERM TO PREVENT THE PRODUCT FROM ENTERING A STORM DRAIN THAT WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET DOWNGRADIENT OF THE RELEASE POINT.  THE UPSTREAM LINE 20 BLOCK VALVE AT LAKE ROAD WAS CLOSED TO MINIMIZE THE DRAIN-UP AT THE POINT OF RELEASE.  TDEC AND NASHVILLE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ARRIVED AT THE LEAK SITE AROUND 09:30.     AT 10:30, EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTORS ARRIVED AND BEGAN TO RECOVER PRODUCT THAT HAD POOLED BEHIND THE CONTAINMENT BERMS WITH VACUUM TRUCKS.  LINE 20 WAS EXCAVATED AND FUEL OIL WAS OBSERVED TO BE DRAINING OUT OF A 1-INCH BY 4-INCH HOLE IN THE PIPELINE.  A VACUUM TRUCK WAS UTILIZED TO CONTAIN AND RECOVER THE REMAINING DRAIN-UP FROM THE LEAK, WHICH CONTINUED UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 12:30.  RECONNAISANCE WAS CONDUCTED IN THE LEAK SITE VICINITY TO IDENTIFIY ALL POTENTIAL PRODUCT RESURGENCE POINTS IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT MIGRATION THROUGH THE SUBSURFACE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTORS DEPLOYED BOOM AT SIX LOCATIONS WITHIN A NEARBY CREEK AND PLUGGED THE STORM SEWER AS A PRECAUTION.  TO DATE, NO PRODUCT HAS MIGRATED TO THE CREEK, STORM DRAIN, OR SANITARY SEWER.  A PRODUCT RECOVERY TRENCH WAS INSTALLED ON THE PIPELINE RIGHT-OF-WAY AT THE BASE OF THE HILL ADJACENT TO NASHBORO BLVD.  APPROXIMATELY 1,500 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WERE RECOVERED FROM THE POOLED PRODUCT LOCATIONS BEHIND THE CONTAINMENT BERMS AND FROM THE RECOVERY TRENCH. THE INITIAL ESTIMATED RELEASE VOLUME OF 200 BARRELS IS BASED UPON LINE FILL CALCULATIONS AND DRAIN-UP ESTIMATES.    BASED UPON A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED AT THE LEAK SITE, IT APPEARS THAT IMPACTS FROM THE RELEASE ARE CONFINED TO AN AREA MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET BY 200 FEET ALONG THE PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY SOUTH OF NASHBORO BLVD.  EXCAVATION EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO REMOVE AN ESTMATED 10,000 TO 12,000 TONS OF SOILS IMPACTED BY THE RELEASE.  EXCAVATION OF THE IMPACTED SOILS IS EXPECTED TO MINIMIZE GROUNDWATER IMPACTS AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR SITE CLOSURE FROM THE TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION.  THE MAJORITY OF PRODUT RECOVERED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE FROM THE EXCAVATION OF IMPACTED SOILS.  THE FINAL VOLUME OF RECOVERED PRODUCT WILL BE DETERMINED UPON COMPLETION OF SOIL EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES.     SITE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.  APPROXIMATELY 9,916 TONS OF IMPACTED SOIL WERE EXCAVATED AND TRANSPORTED TO A LOCAL LANDFILL FOR DISPOSAL.  CLEAN-UP GOALS WERE MET AND A CLOSURE REQUEST WILL BE SUBMITTED TO TDEC IN JANUARY 2007.  NO ADDITIONAL ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED AT THE SITE. AN UPDATED SPILL VOLUME ESTIMATE OF 113 BARRELS HAS BEEN CALCULATED BASED UPON THE COMBINED TOTAL OF THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID PRODUCT RECOVERED AT THE SITE (35 BARRELS) AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF PRODUCT ABSORBED WITHIN IMPACTED SOILS (78 BARRELS) AT THE SITE. THE SPILL VOLUME ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT ALL OF THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED EITHER IN LIQUID PHASE BY VACUUM TRUCK OR IN THE ABSORBED PHASE THROUGH SOIL EXCAVATION AND THAT ONLY NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCT WERE LOST TO EVAPORATION, DISSOLVED IN GROUNDWATER, OR REMAIN WITHIN SITE SOILS.  THIS ASSUMPTION IS BASED UPON THE LOW VOLATILITY AND SOLUBILITY OF FUEL OIL AND THE RESULTS OF SITE INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES."

IN ADDITION TO USE AS A TRANSMIX DELIVERY TANK, IT ALSO SERVES AS A PIPELINE SURGE RELIEF TANK.  ON AUGUST 29, 2006 AT 0730 HOURS LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL FOR THE TRUCK TERMINAL NOTICED A POOL OF TRANSMIX ON TOP OF WATER THAT HAD ACCUMULATED IN A SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DIKE FROM AN OVERNIGHT RAINSTORM.  AN OSRO WAS CONTACTED TO REMOVE THE 800 GALLONS OF TRANSMIX AND 1800 GALLONS OF WATER FROM THE CONTAINMENT DIKE.  THIS SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DIKE IS CONSTRUCTED WITH CONCRETE WALLS AND FLOOR.  DUE TO THIS UNIQUE CONSTRUCTION METHOD OF THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DIKE, NONE OF THE RELEASED TRANSMIX OR WATER IMPACTED THE ENVIRONMENT.    A CERTIFIED TANK INSPECTION CONTRACTOR INSPECTED THE TANK AND DETERMINED THAT THE TANK HAD A HOLE IN THE FLOOR AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL AREAS OF UNDERSIDE PITTING.  DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE UNDERSIDE PITTING AREAS, A NEW SECOND BOTTOM WAS INSTALLED IN THIS TANK.  IN THIS DOUBLE BOTTOM SCENARIO, AN HDPE LINER AND CONCRETE PAD WAS INSTALLED.  THE HDPE LINER ELECTRICALLY DISCONNECTS AND REDUCES THE POSSIBLE CORROSIVE EFFECTS ON THE REPLACEMENT FLOOR AND WILL CHANNEL ANY FUTURE COMMODITY LEAKAGE TO TANK PERIMETER LEAK DETECTION PORTS.    A TEMPORARY RESTRICTION PROHIBITING THE USE OF A LOWER PRESSURE RATED METER PROVER LOOP, FOR WHICH THE SURGE RELIEF SYSTEM IS DESIGNED, WAS PUT INTO PLACE UNTIL THE TANK REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  THESE TEMPORARY MEASURES WERE LIFTED AND THE METER PROVER LOOP WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE AT THE COMPLETION OF THE TANK REPAIRS IN OCTOBER 2006."

THE CONTROL CENTER GAVE ME THE CONTACT NAME AND PHONE NUMBER.  I NOTIFIED ALLEN AT 0807 AND HAD ALLEN TO CONTACT SID WITH HENRY PETROLEUM ABOUT THE PROPOSED LEAK. AN ERL WAS SENT OUT AT 0705 MT ABOUT A PROPOSED LEAK.  ALLEN CALLED ME AT 0910 HRS AND ADVISED THAT SID ADVISED THAT THE LEAK WAS EAST OF THE CITY OF CRANE.  THE ONLY PIPELINE THAT WE HAVE EAST OF CRANE IS THE COMANCHE CREEK LINE.  ALLEN ADVISED THAT AFTER TALKING WITH SID IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS AT THE EOG STATION.  ALLEN PROCEEDED OVER TO THE STATION AND FOUND THAT WE HAD CO2 COMING OUT OF THE GROUND AROUND THE MAINLINE VALVE SITE.  AT THIS TIME I CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER AND ADVISED THEM THAT WE DID IN FACT HAVE A LEAK AND THAT WE NEEDED TO SEND OUT AN ERL WHICH THEY DID.  A CONFERENCE CALL WAS SET UP AND IT WAS DETERMINED TO SHUT IN THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT IN AT 1140 HRS AND WE ALLOWED SACROC TO CONTINUE PULLING ON THE LINE TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE.  AT 1159 HRS BLOCK VALVE 11 WAS CLOSED, AT 1345 BLOCK VALVE 13 WAS CLOSED.  WE STARTED BLOWING DOWN THE PIPELINE AT 1349 HRS WHICH HAD A LINE PRESSURE OF 1301 PSI.  THE BLOCK VALVE AT PUMP 15 WAS CLOSE AT 1631 HRS.  THE LINE WAS BLOW DOWN BY 1920 HRS AND WE STARTED EXCAVATING THE VALVE.  AT 2100 HRS WE SHUT DOWN FOR THE NIGHT AND WOULD CONTINUE THE NEXT DAY.    10-11-06    0800 HRS WE CONTINUED EXCAVATING THE VALVE.  WE FOUND THAT THE LEAK WAS ON THE BODY BLEED LINE OF THE VALVE.  THERE WAS A UNION AND A NIPPLE THAT WAS ONLY HAND TIGHT AND IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS THE POINT OF THE LEAK, BUT THIS WILL NOT BE TOTALLY DETERMINED UNTIL A LAB HAS EXAMINED THE PARTS.  THE REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE VALVE THAT WERE NEEDED WHICH INCLUDED REPLACING THE BODY BLEED LINE AND ALL FOUR OF THE GREASE LINES.  WE STARTED FILLING THE LINE AT 1538 HRS, BLOCK VALVE 13 WAS FULLY OPENED AT 1643 HRS AND BLOCK VALVE 11 WAS FULLY OPEN AT 1700 HRS.  AT THAT TIME THE CONTROL VALVE FEEDING THE CRC PIPELINE WAS PLACED INTO THE AUTOMATIC MODE AND THE CONTROL CENTER THEN HAD CONTROL OF THE REST OF THE FILLING PROCESS.

THE RELEASE WAS CONTAINED INSIDE THE STATION FIREWALL AT THE MIDLAND BASIN TANK FARM.  INVESTIGATION HAS DETERMINED THAT THE ROOF DRAIN ON TANK 1332 FAILED ALLOWING OIL TO EXIT OUT OF THE ROOF DRAIN VALVE INTO THE STATION FIREWALL.  THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE ROOF DRAIN FAILURE IS UNKNOWN AND STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THEREFORE, THE RELEASE IS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER UNTIL THE TANK IS CLEANED AND THE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED.    INITIAL INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE ESTIMATED COST WOULD BE LESS THAN $50,000.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE REMEDIATION COSTS HAVE EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND THE TOTAL COST NOW EXCEEDS $50,000.    PART H7. ITEM 23  DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A SWIVEL JOINT IN THE ROOF DRAIN SYSTEM HAD SEIZED CAUSING THE PIPE TO PULL FROM THE SWIVEL JOINT.  THE SWIVEL JOINTS IN THE ROOF SYSTEM HAD BEEN RECENTLY EPLACED BY A CONTRACTOR ON AN API STANDARD 653 INSPECTION REQUIRED BY 49 CFR 195.432.  THE INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE CONTRACTOR INSTALLED SWIVELS THAT WERE DIFFERENT IN LENGTH, ALTHOUGH THE CONTRACTOR WAS AWARE OF THE DIFFERENT LENGTH OF THE SWIVEL, ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE DRAIN PIPING, BUT THIS ADJUSTMENT PROHIBITED FREE M0MENT OF THE DRAIN PIPING CAUSING SOME SEPARATION OF THE PIPING FROM THE SWIVEL.  THE SWIVEL JOINTS WERE REPLACED BY THE CONTRACTOR UNDER WARRANTY AND RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION."

DUE TO OTHER PIPELINES IN THE AREA, IT WAS NOT DETERMINED UNTIL 12/13/06 THAT THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM THE PLAINS BARKER TO NETTLETON PIPELINE.    THIS RELEASE WAS THE RESULT OF LEAKAGE FROM A SMALL CORROSION RELATED PINHOLE IN THE PIPE BODY.  A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF SCADA FLOW AND PRESSURE RECORDS INDICATED A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN FLOW INTO AND OUT OF THE PIPELINE ON DECEMBER 4, 2006.  THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN AND A THOROUGH ROW SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FOR INDICATION OF LEAKAGE.  NONE WAS FOUND.  PIPELINE OPERATIONS RESUMED BUT SCADA FLOW DATA ON THE PIPELINE DID NOT CONCLUSIVELY INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF A LEAK.  THE OVER AND SHORT DATA PRIOR TO VISUAL DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK INDICATED BOTH SHORT AND OVER CONDITIONS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT LEAKAGE FROM THE SMALL PINHOLE WAS NOT CONSTANT CAUSING THE OVER/SHORT INDICATIONS TO BE ERRATIC AND INCONCLUSIVE.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CORROSION PRODUCTS OR OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS WOULD SOMETIME PLUG THE HOLE CAUSING THE LEAKAGE TO STOP.    THE INITIAL FIELD ASSESSMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COSTS WOULD NOT EXCEED THE REPORTING THRESHOLD OF $50,000.  ON 12/20/06 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000.  THIS WAS DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION AREA BEING LARGER THAN THE INITIAL EVALUATION AND THAT THE CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR PLANNED TREATMENT OPTIONS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE HAULED OFF SITE AND LAND FARMED.  SINCE THIS RELEASE OCCURRED ON AN INTRASTATE PIPELINE AND BEING WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF GLADEWATER, ON 12/20/06, A TELEPHONE CALL WAS MADE TO THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS KILGORE (REGION 3) PIPELINE SAFETY OFFICE AND THE RAILROAD COMMISSION'S EMERGENCY LINE, RRC REPORT NUMBER 07-HC-256.    REF: PART A, PAR. 5. ""LOSSES"" AND PART F, PAR. 2.B. ""ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT"":  THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN COST WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REMOVAL AND TRANSPORT OF APPROXIMATELY 7000 CUBIC YARDS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL TO AN OFFSITE FACILITY AND IMPORTING CLEAN FILL DIRT."

THE PUMP WAS SHUTDOWN AND LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED ALONG WITH AREA PIPELINE PERSONNEL.  THE FIRE WAS OUT PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND PIPELINE PERSONNEL AT ABOUT 1700 HOURS.  IMMEDIATE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SCENE DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE WAS LIMITED TO THE AREA OF THE PUMP OUTBOARD SEAL AND BEARINGS WITH NO EVIDENCE OF LEAKING OR SPILLED GASOLINE ON THE PUMP EQUIPMENT OR GROUND SURROUNDING THE PUMP FOUNDATION.    INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT DETERMINED THAT THE PUMP SEAL AND BEARING FAILED.  THE FAILURE RESULTED IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE OUTBOARD SEAL AND BEARING TO OVERHEAT, WHICH IGNITED RESIDUAL LUBRICANTS AND POSSIBLY GASOLINE MIST LEAKING FROM THE SEAL AREA.  THE FIRE BURNED ITSELF OUT AFTER RESIDUAL LUBRICANTS ON THE PUMP WERE CONSUMED AND ELIMINATION OF POSSIBLE PUMP SEAL MISTING ONCE THE PUMP WAS SHUT DOWN.  THE DAMAGE TO THE PUMP SEALS AND BEARING HOUSING REQUIRED THE PUMP TO BE SENT TO A REPAIR SHOP.  THE INVESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THAT THE PUMP DE-STAGING, COMPLETED SOME 15 YEARS AGO, RESULTED IN A THRUST IMBALANCE OF THE SHAFT AND LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE BEARING FAILURE AND RESULTANT FIRE.  ADDITIONAL WORK WAS PREFORMED ON THE PUMP TO HYDRAULICALLY REBALANCE THE PUMP INTERNALS, ELIMINATE FOUND PUMP CASE WASH-OUTS AND TO REPAIR THE SHAFT.  THE LINE WAS RUN AT A REDUCED RATE WITHOUT SYLVANIA PUMP STATION DURING THE PUMP REPAIR PROCESS AND WAS RETURNED TO FULL SERVICE ON JANUARY 18, 2007 WHEN THE REPAIRED PUMP WAS REINSTALLED.

AFTER REMOVAL OF OIL REMAINING IN THE TANK & CLEAN UP OF OIL SPILLED IN THE TANK CONTAINMENT AREA, CREWS WERE ABLE TO SAFELY ENTER THE TANK ON 2-28-07.

GASOLINE WAS LEAKING OUT OF A VAULT WHERE TAKEOFF PIPING CONNECTS THE LINE TO A PREVIEW DENSITOMETER. THE LEAK SITE IS ENTIRELY CONTAINED IN THE MARATHON TERMINAL, LOCATED AT 28001 CITRON ROAD. THE LEAK ORIGINATED ON THE TAKEOFF PIPING AND WAS FROM A THREADED 2-INCH UNION.  IT APPEARS AS IF THE THREADED UNION LIKELY LOOSENED FROM FREEZE-THAW CYCLES ACTING ON THE UNION AND ATTACHED 2-INCH PIPING.    THE INITIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE WAS TO SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE. THE VAULT WAS PUMPED OUT WITH A VACUUM TRUCK. APPROXIMATELY 600 GALLONS OF GASOLINE WAS COLLECTED. NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE MI DEQ FOR POTENTIAL TO IMPACT GROUNDWATER, AS WELL AS 911 (ROMULUS FIRE DEPARTMENT). IN THE CASE OF THE 911 NOTIFICATION, THE DISPATCHER DEEMED THE NOTIFICATION AS NON-EMERGENCY AND MADE NO REPORT NOR RESPONDED ANY EMERGENCY SERVICES.  A REPORT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS LATER MADE ON MARCH 13 WHEN A SHEEN WAS DISCOVERED ON NEARBY WATER.    FOR SAFETY OF THE WORK CREW, THE ENTIRE VAULT WAS REMOVED, AND AREA WAS EXCAVATED.  ABOUT 80 YARDS OF SPOILS WERE COLLECTED INTO ROLL-OFF BOXES FOR DISPOSAL.  MONITORING WELLS AND SAMPLING HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON THE IMPACTED AREA BY A GROUND WATER CONSULTANT FOR SITE ASSESSMENT.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE SITE WILL BE CLEARED FOR CLOSURE BY THE MI DEQ IN THE NEAR FUTURE."

ON 7/3/07 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST COULD EXCEED $50,000 AND THE NRC AND THE OKLAHOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION PIPELINE SAFETY DEPARTMENT WERE NOTIFIED.

THE LEAK WAS INITIALLY FOUND BY THE LANDOWNER BETWEEN 12PM AND 1PM AND REPORTED IT TO PHMSAS SOUTHWEST REGIONAL OFFICE IN HOUSTON BY PHONE. PERSONNEL AT PHMSA RELAYED THE INFORMATION BY EMAIL TO KINDER MORGAN VP-ENGINEERING/OPS WHO THEN FORWARD IT ON TO THE CORRECT BUSINESS UNIT. THE LEAK OCCURRED FROM A PIN-HOLE INTERNAL CORROSION CELL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ABOVEGROUND SECTION OF THE PIGGING BYPASS.  AFTER THE LEAK WAS VERIFIED THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LANDOWNER, THE LINE WAS SHUT DOWN AT ABOUT 3:20 PM.  THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED AT 4:00 PM  NRC# 837649RAWLS. THE TXRRC MIDLAND OFFICE WAS NOTIFIED AT 4:12, JOB NUMBER 70-5795 WAS ASSIGNED TO THE SPILL. KM PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT GUADALUPE STATION AT 5:00 PM AND ISOLATED THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPE. OIL RAN OFFSITE DOWN THE DIRT ROAD TO A LOW SPOT CONTAINING RAINWATER WHERE IT POOLED AND THEN HAD SHEEN OF OIL FLOW OUT THROUGH THE BRUSH ON TOP OF RAINWATER IN NARROW PATHWAYS APPROXIMATELY 1-2 WIDE LEAVING ONLY A RESIDUAL AMOUNT OF OIL ON THE GRASS.  A OIL SPILL VOLUME WAS CALCULATED AT 74.4 BBLS, WITH 20 BBLS OF OIL BEING RECOVERED ALONG WITH 70 BBLS OF RAINWATER.  PHMSA AND EPA SENT PERSONNEL TO THE SITE ON 6/6 TO INVESTIGATE.  THE PHMSA REPRESENTATIVE WAS ALSO ON SITE 6/7.   BY THE END OF THE DAY ON 6/6, ALL OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL HAD BEEN SCRAPED UP INTO PILES AND WAS BEING MOVED VIA DUMP TRUCK TO A REMEDIATION SITE ON THE GUADALUPE STATION PROPERTY. ADDITIONALLY ON 6/6 THE ENTIRE 20 BYPASS LINE WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE AND BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED ON THE 20 VALVES ADJACENT TO THE BYPASS PIPELINE. THE 20 PIPE WILL BE SENT OFF FOR ANALYSIS FOR INTERNAL CORROSION. ON 6/7 CREWS CONTINUED TO MOVE THE CONTAMINATED SOIL TO THE REMEDIATION SITE. SOIL STOCKPILED ON KINDER MORGAN PROPERTY, SAMPLES WILL BE COLLECTED ON 6/12 FOR HAZARD CHARACTERISTICS AND TPH."

THE OWNER OF THE EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANY PERFORMING THE WORK ADMITTED THAT HE HAD INSTRUCTED HIS 70 YEAR OLD DOZER OPERATOR TO NOT WORK WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE PIPELINE.  NO ONE-CALL WAS PLACED BY THE CONTRACTOR WITH PA ONE-CALL FOR THIS WORK.    THE RELEASE WAS DETECTED BY THE PIPELINE CPM/SCADA-BASED LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM AND THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  APPROXIMATELY 63,000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE (93 CF20) WAS RELEASED IN THE STRIP MINE AREA.  THE EQUIPMENT OPERATOR WHO STRUCK THE PIPELINE WAS HOSPITALIZED.  GASOLINE ODORS TRAVELED DOWN GRADIENT TO AN AREA OF HOMES AND THREE SCHOOL BUILDINGS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF A MILE FROM THE RELEASE.  LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS INITIATED A PRECAUTIONARY EVACUATION OF APPROXIMATELY 150 RESIDENTS FROM 45 HOMES AND 3,400 STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STAFF FROM THE SCHOOLS.  MONITORING COMPLETED BY SUNOCO PIPELINE PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF ELEVATED LEVELS OF  HYDROCARBONS IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREA OR SCHOOLS BUT SOME THESE BUILDINGS WERE NOT REOCCUPIED FOR APPROXIMATELY 42 HOURS PENDING COMPLETION OF AIR SAMPLING.    PA STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINING OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL MINE SAFETY AND DOT PHMSA PIPELINE SAFETY OFFICIALS RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT FOR INVESTIGATION.  LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT INDICATES NO IMPACT TO SURFACE OR GROUND WATER.  RELEASED PRODUCT THAT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY VOLATILIZE OR THAT HAS NOT BEEN RECOVERED OR REMEDIATED IS PRINCIPALLY CONTAINED IN MADE LAND SOILS FROM HISTORIC COAL MINING ACTIVITIES.  A LEGAL SETTLEMENT HAS RESULTED IN ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINAL REMEDIATION TO THE PROPERTY OWNER.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE REMEDIATION OF THE SOILS WILL BE DONE BY INCINERATION AT A LOCAL PLANT WITH THE APPROVAL OF PA DEP.  THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACEMENT OF THE DAMAGED PIPE WITH A NEW SECTION OF PIPE."

CPC AND CONTRACT ROW PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO INVESTIGATE AND CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF A SMALL SHEEN AT THE PIPELINE CROSSING OF WILLIAMSON CREEK.  THE AREA OF THE SHEEN MEASURED FROM 4 TO 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND APPEARED SPORADICALLY.  THE SHEEN EVAPORATED QUICKLY AND DID NOT MIGRATE OR ACCUMULATE DOWNSTREAM.  LINE 1 WAS SHUTDOWN AT 08:00 HOURS ON TUESDAY.   THE SED RESPONSE TEAM WAS MOBILIZED TO THE SITE AND THE INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE ESTABLISHED.   CONTRACT CREWS ARRIVED ON SCENE AND INITIATED RESPONSE ACTIONS WHICH INCLUDED THE INSTALLATION OF TWO UNDERFLOW DAMS, RIVER BOOM AND ABSORBENT BOOM  JUST DOWNSTREAM OF THE ROW CROSSING IN WILLIAMSON CREEK.  TWO ADDITIONAL BOOM CONTAINMENT SITES WHERE INSTALLED AT THE HIGHWAY 316 AND BEN JOHNSON ROAD CROSSINGS OF WILLIAMSON CREEK DOWNSTREAM OF THE ROW.  THE CREEK FLOW WAS DIVERTED AROUND THE ROW CROSSING  USING AN UPSTREAM DAM AND PUMP.  EXCAVATION AND INSPECTION OF THE LINE BEGAN ON 5/30/07 ONCE THE SITE WAS SECURE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTAINMENT MEASURES WERE IN PLACE. DRAIN-UP OPERATIONS OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF LINE WERE ALSO INITIATED. INSPECTION OF THE LINE DID NOT IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK DUE TO THE LOW RELEASE RATE AND REDUCED PRESSURE WITHIN THE PIPELINE.  DRAIN-UP OF THE AFFECTED SEGMENT OF LINE 1  WAS COMPLETED ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 2 AND AN 80-FOOT SECTION OF PIPE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED.  THIRD-PARTY EVALUATION DETERMINED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A CIRCUMFERENTIALLY ORIENTED THROUGH-WALL CRACK APPROXIMATELY 3.5 INCHES LONG LOCATED WITHIN THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED. THE THIRD-PARTY REPORT STATES THAT THE CRACK BEGAN AND GREW DUE TO STRESS CORROSION CRACKING, THEN GREW BY CORROSION FATIGUE, AND THEN FAILED DUE TO DUCTILE OVERSTRESS OF THE REMAINING LIGAMENT.     THE RELEASE WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC AT 10:00 HOURS ON 5/29/07 AND TO THE GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURSES (GA DNR) ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION (EPD) AT 10:00 HOURS ON 5/29/07 DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A SHEEN IN THE CREEK AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO GROUNDWATER.    APPROXIMATELY 3046 TONS OF IMPACTED SOIL WERE EXCAVATED IN THE VICINITY OF THE RELEASE AREA AND TRANSPORTED TO THE NEARBY REPUBLIC LANDFILL FOR DISPOSAL.  LABORATORY ANALYSES OF THE SOIL INDICATE THAT AN ESTIMATED 139 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WERE RELEASED TO AND CONTAINED WITHIN THE IMPACTED SOIL.  A TOTAL OF 25 GALLONS OF FREE PHASE PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED FROM THE EXCAVATION AREA.  AN ESTIMATED 38 GALLONS OF THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS LOST TO EVAPORATION.  BASED ON THESE ESTIMATES, THE TOTAL RELEASE VOLUME IS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 200 GALLONS.    ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS WERE COMPLETED ON 6/11/07.  A REPORT DOCUMENTING RESPONSE AND REMEDIATION ACTIONS WITH A REQUEST FOR SITE CLOSURE WAS SUBMITTED TO THE GA EPD IN DECEMBER 2007."

A CONTRACTOR CREW WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO EXCAVATE THE LINE AND INSPECT THE ANOMALY.   A COLONIAL INSPECTOR REACHED THE SITE AT 15:10 AND REPORTED A 3' X 3' AREA OF STAINED SOIL WITH AN ODOR OF GASOLINE ON THE GROUND SURFACE ABOVE LINE 19 AT THE LOCATION OF THE ANOMALY.  LINE 18 WAS ALSO SHUT DOWN AS A PRECAUTION UNTIL THE LEAK SOURCE COULD BE DISCOVERED.  LINE 19 WAS BLOCKED AT ROME AND AT CHATTANOOGA JCT.  ONCE THE SITE WAS SECURE AND SAFE CONDITIONS WERE ESTABLISHED AND VERIFIED, A CONTRACT CREW BEGAN EXCAVATION OF THE SITE AT 18:50.  THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED ON LINE 19 AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION AT 19:20.  LINE 18 RESTARTED AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK ON LINE 19.  THE LEAK WAS PLUGGED AND A TYPE B SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON LINE 19.  THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AND THE LINE RESTARTED AT 03:10 ON 06/02/07.    RECONNAISSANCE ACTITIVITIES WERE IMMEDIATELY INITIATED IN THE SURROUNDING AREA TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE RELEASE.  EVIDENCE OF THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS LIMITED TO THE 3' X 3' SOIL STAIN ABOVE LINE 19 AT THE LOCATION OF THE ANOMALY.  A NUMBER OF SURFACE WATER FEATURES (SPRINGS AND CREEKS) WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE VICINITY OF THE RELEASE.   NO IMPACTS TO SURFACE WATER HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH OBSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY SAMPLING OF THE IDENTIFED FEATURES.   ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING SURFACE WATER SAMPLING AND THE INSTALLATION OF SOIL BORINGS WERE CONDUCTED IN 2007.   SITE INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED TO DATE INDICATE THAT THE RELEASE DID NOT  INPACT GROUNDWATER.  APPROXIMATELY 330 TONS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WERE EXCAVATED IN DECEMBER 2007.    A LIMITED AMOUNT OF SOIL IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE POINT OF RELEASE COULD NOT BE EXCAVTED DUE TO THE DEPTH OF THE SOIL AND THE LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE.  ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED THROUGH JULY 2008 CONFIRM THE LIMITED EXTENT OF THE REMAINING CONTAMINATED SOIL. CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING SITE CLOSURE WITH GA EPD. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FUTURE ACTIVITIES WILL BE LIMITED TO SURFACE WATER SAMPLING AND MONITORING.  AN ESTIMATED 25 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WERE RECOVERED THROUGH SOIL EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES.  NO FREE PHASE PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECOVERED.  TOTAL VOLUME RECOVERED TO DATE IS 25 GALLONS.  THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE RELEASE HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO $129,600 AND INCLUDES FUTURE ANTICIPATED SITE MONITORING COSTS."

HE CONTACTED EMPCO.  EMPCO IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED PERSONNEL TO THE SITE. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE SPILL OR SHEEN ON WATER. PERSONNEL MOBILIZED VESSELS ON THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER AND OBSERVED SMALL VOLUME OF BUBBLES IN THE VICINITY OF EMPCO'S RIGHT OF WAY.  DIVERS WERE MOBILIZED AND LOCATED SMALL LEAK SITE ON BOTTOM OF EMPCO'S PIPELINE ON 6/14/07.  THE SITE WAS SUCCESSFULLY CLAMPED.  THE NRC WAS CONTACTED UPON EMPCO'S DETERMINATION THAT THE $50,000 COSTS CRITERIA WAS IMMINENT (AT APPROXIMATELY 1800 HOURS).  AT THAT TIME THE LEAK VOLUME WAS BELIEVED TO BE MINIMAL/LESS THAN REPORTING CRITERIA.  BASED UPON SUBSEQUENT FACT GATHERING, EMPCO ESTIMATES THAT THE LEAK COULD HAVE OCCURRED AS EARLY AS MAY 2, 2007.  IT WAS SO SMALL AND SLOW THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN VISIBLE DURING REGULAR AERIAL PATROLS. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS REPORT, A REVIEW OF RECORDS WAS CONDUCTED AND BASED ON THAT DATA, EMPCO ESTIMATED WORST CASE VOLUME LPG RAWMAKE LOSS.  PART E, NO. 2 SUPPLEMENTAL EXPLANATION - THE PIPELINE WAS EXPOSED IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK FOR APPROXIMATELY 250 FEET, AND ANOTHER EXPOSED SECTION WAS FOUND AT STA. # 465+03, LENGTH OF EXPOSURE 450 FEET.  THE LINE HAD BEEN SURVEYED AND FOUND APPROPRIATELY BURIED IN JUNE 2005, PRIOR TO HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA.  SCOURING DUE TO RIVER CURRENTS EXPOSED THE PIPELINE AND ALLOWED A STUMP TO BECOME LODGED UNDER IT.    DIVERS REMOVED THE LARGE STUMP THAT WAS WEDGED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PIPELINE AT THE LEAK SITE.  BASED ON PINHOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF SMALL INDENTATION AT CONTACT POINT OF STUMP, IT IS LIKELY THE STUMP CONTRIBUTED TO THE DAMAGE.  EMPCO OBTAINED THE USCG'S CONCURRENCE BEFORE SANDBAGGING BOTH SHALLOW SITES.  THUS, THE PIPELINE IS NOT A HAZARD TO NAVIGATION.  THE LINE SECTION WAS DISPLACED WITH NITROGEN, ISOLATED, DISCONNECTED AND IDLED."

LOCAL KANEB PERSONEL INVESTIGATED REPORT AND VERIFIED THE SMELL OF AMMONIA IN THE SOIL.  THE PIPE WAS EXCAVATED ON 6.4.07 FOR INVESTIGATION.  A SMALL LEAK WAS FOUND AT APPROXIMATELY 12:40 ORIGINATING FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 12:45 AND CLOSEST UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM VALVES WERE CLOSED TO ISOLATE THE LEAK.    THE LEAK WAS CLAMPED AT APPROXIMATELY 13:00 STOPPING THE LEAK.  THE PIPE WAS EFFECTIVELY REPAIRED AND RETURNED TO SERVICE AT APPROXIMATELY 20:30 ON 5.6.07.    TELEPHONIC REPORTING NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY MO LEPC, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT TIME OF DISCOVERY.    THE AFFECTED JOINT OF PIPE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND SENT TO KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES FOR INDEDPENDENT ANALYSIS.     SUMMARY & CONCLUSION OF KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES ANALYSIS:  THE LEAK OCCURED IN THE ERW SEAM OF THE PIPE SPECIMEN AND WAS CAUSED BY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. THE DEFECT IS CONSISTENT WITH A COLD WELD (LACK OF FUSION) CAUSED BY CONTAMINATION OF THE COIL EDGES DURING FORMATION OF THE ERW WELD.  THE WELD DEFECT WAS ORIGINALLY FILLED WITH BRASS (A COPPER ZINC ALLOY)   FROM THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT BLOCKED LEAKAGE EARLY-ON IN THE LIFE OF THE PIPE.  WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, THE FOREIGN MATERIAL IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DETERIORATED BY DISSOLUTION OR FRACTURING, THEREBY PERMITTING LEAKAGE.        4/20/2010 -- REPORT UPDATED PER RESULTS OF LEAK REVIEW SPRING 2010. NO CHANGE IN CAUSE."

WHEN THE SUMP WAS FULL OF WATER, THE CRUDE OIL IN THE SUMP WAS FORCED OUT THE GAUGING HATCH. THE HIGH SUMP ALARM CAUSED THE STATION TO SHUT DOWN AND PIPELINE PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED. DUE TO FLOODING, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF A PROBLEM EXISTED.

THE RELEASE TOOK PLACE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME ONCE THE SUMP TANK WAS FULL OF WATER. IT IS ESTIMATED THE RELEASE BEGAN AND ENDED WITHIN A 15 MINUTE PERIOD. THE SUMP TANK IS USED TO COLLECT ANY OIL ASSOCIATED WITH ABOVE GROUND EQUIPMENT SUCH AS PUMP SEAL FLUSHES AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. THE SUMP LEVEL IS MAINTAINED AT 2 TO 3 BARRELS OF OIL. THE RELEASED CRIDE OIL FROM THE SUMP TANK FLOWED WITH THE FLOOD WATERS OVER WELD COUNTY ROAD 20 DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE PUMP STATION AND MOVED WITH THE FLOOD WATERS ALONG THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD BERM SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET TO THE WEST.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD INITIALLY SHUT DOWN RAUCH ROAD, TELEGRAPH ROAD AND THE ADJOINING RAILROAD TRACKS. THE LINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN, WHICH AT THE TIME WAS MOVING JET A. REGIONAL EMPLOYEES WERE NOTIFIED AT 13:00 TO RESPOND TO THE LEAK SITE.     WHEN SUNOCO LOGISTICS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ONSITE, THEY VERIFIED THAT THE LEAK HAD STOPPED AND THAT ALL PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED IN THE OPEN EXCAVATION AROUND THE VALVE SITE. AIR MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED TO VERIFY SAFE CONDITIONS, AND ALL ROADWAYS WERE REOPENED AT 14:00. MARINE POLLUTION CONTROL WAS CALLED IN TO PUMP OUT THE SPILLED PRODUCT, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 BBLS OF JET A. ALL PRODUCT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE BY 19:00. FURTHER SOIL REMEDIATION WILL BE CONDUCTED AS REQUIRED.    THE LEAK WAS ON A FLANGE ON THE NEWLY INSTALLED ABOVE GRADE MLV AT RAUCH ROAD, WHICH HAD REPLACED A BELOW GRADE VALVE LOCATED ONE MILE SOUTH. THE WORK ON THE MLV WAS COMPLETED FRIDAY EVENING. THE LINE HAD STARTED UP AT 05:30 ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 4 AFTER LINE FILLING AND PROOF TESTING OF THE ROUGE LINE. THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE FLANGE HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY TORQUED, NOR HAD THE SITE BEEN VISIBLY INSPECTED BEFORE START UP. WHEN RESPONDERS ARRIVED ONSITE, THEY FOUND SOME OF THE FLANGE BOLTS WERE ONLY HAND TIGHT. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE LOOSENED FLANGE IS THE FACT THAT THE CRIBBING SUPPORTING THE LINE HAD SUNK 2- 3 INCHES AFTER INSTALLATION.     THE RESPONDING CREW REPLACED THE GASKET AND PROPERLY TORQUED THE FLANGE. WORK WAS COMPLETED BY 20:30. PRESSURE TESTING WAS CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED AT 02:10 ON AUGUST 6, AT WHICH TIME THE LINE WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE.  THE OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS OF ALL MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL INVOLVED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE MLV WERE SUSPENDED PENDING TRAINING AND RE-QUALIFICATION."

MAC TAYLOR	6787622872	ATAYLOR@COLPIPE.COM	6787622464	"AT APPROXIMATELY 1824 HOURS ON TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 11TH THE CONTROL CENTER STARTED THE LINE 1 UNIT 3 AT EPES STATION.  AT SOME TIME AFTER THIS START UP THE BEARING SEAL ON THE OUTBOARD END OF THE #3 PUMP FAILED AND BEGAN TO ALLOW PRODUCT (GASOLINE) TO FLOW INTO THE PUMPS BUFFALO SYSTEM LEAK CONTAINMENT BOX.  UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE PRODUCT WOULD BACK UP INTO THE BOX IF A PUMP SEAL IS LEAKING BADLY AND RAISE THE FLOAT IN THE BOX WHICH WOULD ALARM THE CONTROL CENTER AND AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATE THE PUMP UNIT.  UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS CASE THE FLOAT MECHANISM ALSO FAILED WHICH ALLOWED GASOLINE TO OVERFLOW THE BOX AND SPILL OUT ONTO THE GROUND.  AT THE SAME TIME THE GASOLINE IS SPILLING OUT ON THE GROUND, SOME OF THE PRODUCT WAS FLOWING THROUGH THE DRAIN PIPING TO THE SUMP.  AT 0205 ON SEPTEMBER 12TH THE CONTROL CENTER RECEIVED A HIGH SUMP ALARM AT EPES STATION AND GENERATED A CALLOUT TO THE LOCAL TECHNICIAN. THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE STATION AROUND 0322 AT WHICH TIME HE DISCOVERED THE PRODUCT BEING RELEASED FROM THE PUMP UNIT AND NOTIFIED THE CONTROL CENTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED THE UNIT.  THE GROUND AT EPES STATION WAS PUDDLED AFTER A RAINFALL EVENT EARLIER THAT NIGHT AND INITIALLY DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS ABOUT 1 BARREL OF GASOLINE RELEASED. NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE OPERATIONS MANAGER AT 03:53 WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER AND DISTRICT LEADER. THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER DECIDED TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE SCENE UPON NOTIFICATION AND THE DISTRICT LEADER NOTIFIED THE GENERAL MANAGER OF OPERATIONS VIA E-MAIL DUE TO THE TIME OF DAY AND THE RELATIVELY LOW AMOUNT OF THE RELEASE AT THAT TIME. THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER ARRIVED ON SCENE SHORTLY AFTER 0600 ON THE 12TH AND BEGAN TO ASSIST THE LOCAL TECHNICIAN WITH THE SITE ASSESSMENT.  AS THE SUN BEGAN TO RISE ALLOWING THEM TO BETTER ASSESS THE SCENE THEY WERE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PRODUCT LEVEL IN THE OIL WATER SEPARATOR WAS GREATER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT AND THAT THERE WAS STILL SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF GASOLINE IN THE YARD SUB SURFACE DRAINAGE SYSTEM.  THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER NOTIFIED THE DISTRICT LEADER AROUND 0730 THAT THE VOLUME ESTIMATE SHOULD BE INCREASED TO 50 BARRELS. IN ADDITION HE ESCALATED THE RESPONSE EFFORT ORDERING ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND RESOURCES.  THE PROJECT LEADER WAS PUT ON STANDBY (LOCATED AT THE TIME IN BATON ROUGE, LA) TO ASSIST.  THE DISTRICT LEADER NOTIFIED THE GENERAL MANAGER OF OPERATIONS VIA PHONE CALL OF THE REVISED VOLUME AMOUNT.  AFTER DISCUSSION IT WAS DECIDED THAT A GROUP 4 PAGE SHOULD BE ISSUED TO INFORM THE REST OF MANAGEMENT OF THE ISSUE.  THE CONTROL CENTER ISSUED THE GROUP 4 AFTER BEING INSTRUCTED BY THE DISTRICT LEADER TO DO SO.  AS THE DAY PROGRESSED AND MORE RESOURCES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, MINOR EXCAVATIONS WERE MADE IN THE STATION YARD AND THE YARD REPEATEDLY FLOODED WITH WATER.  FREE PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED AND PUMPED INTO THE UTILITY TANK ON SITE.  AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THE FREE PRODUCT IN THE YARD HAD BEEN RECOVERED.  A TOTAL OF 63 BARRELS WERE RECOVERED.  WORK CONTINUED ON THE 13TH WITH ADDITIONAL FLOODING OF THE STATION TO SATISFY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF EPA REGION 4 AND THE STATE OF ALABAMA.  NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED.  ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND PROPERLY DISPOSED OF."

UPON DEPRESSURIZING THE LINE SECTION BETWEEN THE PROPERTY BLOCKS, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE DISCHARGE DRAIN VALVE WAS PARTIAL OPEN.  THE VALVE WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE AND HELD FOR TESTING.  AFTER TWO YEARS, THE VALVE WAS ACCIDENTLY DISPOSED OF BY AN OPERATOR CLEANING UP THE WAREHOUSE. OUR TECHNICIANS LOOKED AT THE VALVE AND OPERATED IT AFTER IT WAS REMOVED AND COULDNT FIND ANY DEFICIENCIES WITH IT.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1215, WHEN THE AVIATION JET FUEL ARRIVED AT PAULSBORO, THE LOCAL OPERATOR TRIED TO OPEN MOV 3 VIA THE LOCAL SCADA TO ALLOW THE JET TO PASS THROUGH THE FILTERS (WHEN MOV 3 OPENS, MOV 14 AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES) WITHOUT HAVING ALL REQUIRED VALVES IN PROPER POSITON. THEREFORE, MOV 3 WOULD NOT OPEN ON THE OPERATORS COMMAND FROM THE HMI SCREEN IN THE CONTROL ROOM. NOT RELIZING THE INCORRECT SCADA OPERATION, THE OPERATOR WENT OUT TO MOV 3, PUT THE VALVE IN LOCAL CONTROL AND THEN OPENED THE VALVE. THE MOTOR OPERATED TANK VALVE DOWNSTREAM OF MOV 3 WAS NOT OPEN  THEREFORE THERE WAS NOT AN OPEN PATH FOR THE PRODUCT FLOW RESULTING IN A PRESSURE SURGE ON THE MANIFOLD. THE CLAY FILTER VESSEL IS RATED FOR A MAX WORKING PRESSURE OF 150 PSI; THE PRESSURE SURGE REACHED APPROXIMATELY 388 PSI. PRODUCT LEAKED FROM THE BOLTED LID CONNECTION ON THE VESSEL INTO THE CONTAINMENT AREA AROUND THE VESSEL AND INTO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR. THE OPERATOR HIT THE EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN BUTTON TO SHUT DOWN THE OPERATION. APPROXIMATELY 500 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED FROM THE OIL WATER SEPARATOR AND SOIL AND STONE IN THE AREA. THE OPERATOR'S OQ QUALIFICATION FOR THIS COVERED TASK WERE SUSPENDED, THE OPERATOR RETRAINED AND TESTED.

ON FEBRUARY 11, 2008, AT 9:25 AM EST, A CALL WAS RECEIVED AT THE MARATHON PIPE LINE LLC (MPL) FINDLAY OPERATIONS CENTER FROM A CALLER IN RURAL CLARK COUNTY KENTUCKY STATING THAT CRUDE OIL WAS EVIDENT IN AN AREA NEAR THE MPL OWENSBORO TO CATLETTSBURG (OWC) PIPELINE SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND FIELD TECHNICIANS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  AN INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE WAS PUT INTO PLACE TO CONTAIN AND COLLECT THE RELEASED OIL.    A SIMULTANEOUS EFFORT WAS INITIATED TO LOCATE THE LEAK SOURCE AND REPAIR THE PIPE.  THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE A SLEEVE, WHICH RECORDS INDICATE WAS INSTALLED IN 1986 AND IT IS IN AN HCA.  THE HIGH PRESSURE AT THE POINT OF THE LEAK, ESTABLISHED OVER THE LAST 60 DAYS, IS 643 PSI.  ON FEBRUARY 11, 2008, THE PRESSURE AT THE LEAK SITE WAS 479 PSI.  EARLY ON FEBRUARY 13, 2008, THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS EXCAVATED BY MPL AND INSPECTED BY MPL AND KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES.  THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT INDICATED A FILLET WELD CRACK ON A CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD OF THE FULL ENCIRCLEMENT SLEEVE.   POST INCIDENT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELEASE:  1. POOR CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES WHEN THE PIPE WAS INSTALLED ALLOWED MANY BOTTOM-SIDE DENTS TO FORM ON THE LINE WHEN IT WAS PLACED INTO SERVICE;  2. STRESS RISERS FROM THE DENT ALONG WITH THE DISBONDED COATING (WHICH SHIELDED CP) AND SOIL CONDITIONS ALLOWED FOR NEAR NEUTRAL PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKING TO START IN THE DENT.  3. THE UPSTREAM SEAL WELD APPLIED IN 1986 WAS POORLY DEPOSITED AT THE 6 OCLOCK POSITION DUE TO 1) POOR SLEEVE FIT AND 2) LACK OF SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE UNDER THE PIPE FOR REPAIR WELDING.  THIS LED TO WATER INFILTRATION UNDER THE SLEEVE, WHICH ALLOWED A CORROSION CELL TO FORM OVER TIME.  THE EXISTING SLEEVE SHIELDED THIS AREA FROM CP.  4. THE LACK OF STEEL PUTTY IN THE DENT ALLOWED A SLIGHT MOVEMENT IN THE DENT, WHICH ALLOWED FLEXURE FATIGUE.  5. THE COATING REPAIR ON THE SLEEVE FAILED TO KEEP GROUND WATER FROM INFILTRATING INTO THE FAILED UPSTREAM SEAL WELD.    ALL THESE FACTORS TOGETHER RESULTED IN A 5 INCH LONG CRACK FORMING IN THE DENT UNDER THE SLEEVE.  THE SPILL VOLUME WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 63 BBLS.  THE RATE AND VOLUME OF THE LEAK WAS BELOW FOC CPM DETECTION THRESHOLDS. PI REPRESENTATIVES BELIEVE THAT ALTHOUGH THE SLEEVE WAS NOT LIQUID TIGHT, THE SLEEVE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING THE STRENGTH OF THE PIPING AND PREVENTED A MAJOR RELEASE.  FOR PIPELINE SYSTEMS OPERATED BY MPL, THE RISK OF THE A1 SLEEVE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO BE UNIQUE TO THE OWC SYSTEM DUE TO 1) THE OWC SYSTEMS UNIQUELY HIGH DIAMETER/THICKNESS RATIO, AND 2) THE SYSTEM'S SPECIFIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SCC.  CAUSAL FACTOR: UPSTREAM SEAL WELD AT BOTTOM OF PIPE WAS POORLY DEPOSITED. ROOT CAUSE: STANDARD FOR APPLICATION OF SLEEVE NOT STRICT ENOUGH. THE SLEEVE PROCEDURE USED ON THIS REPAIR IN 1986 IS NO LONGER USED.    THE LEAKING PIPE AND SLEEVE WERE ULTIMATELY REPLACED WITH APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET OF PRE-TESTED PIPE.  THE CONTAMINATED SOIL AND WATER WERE DISPOSED.  MARATHON DEVELOPED A SAMPLING PLAN WITH THE REMEDIATION PLAN ENCOMPASSING 10 YEARS OF MONITORING.    TONNAGE OF EARTH WAS 952.62 TONS AND CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON WET EXCAVATED EARTH EQUALING 100LBS/CUBIC FT.      THIS REPORT IS BEING CLOSED WITH ESTIMATED FUTURE COSTS BECAUSE THE REMEDIATION PLAN CALLS FOR 10 YEARS OF MONITORING.  ESTIMATE IS BASED ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND AN APPROVED REMEDIATION PLAN.    4/23/2010 - UPDATED AFTER DISCUSSION WHILE FINALIZING THE CLOSURE REPORT FOR KDEP. VOLUME RELEASED AND RECOVERED WAS CHANGED FROM 63 TO 70 BBLS. FINAL CALCULATED VOLUME WAS DETERMINED TO BE 69.7 BBLS, WHICH WAS ROUNDED UP TO 70 DUE TO CONSTRAINSTS ON THIS FORM. ALSO DURING THIS REVIEW, THE CALCULATION FOR THE CUBIC YARDS OF SOIL DISPOSED WAS REVISITED, AND AN ERROR IN THE CALCULATION WAS IDENTIFIED. THE STE P THAT CONVERTED FROM CUBIC FEET TO CUBIC YARDS WAS MISSING. THE REVISED CALCULATION, WHICH IS STILL BASED ON 952.62 TONS OF SOIL DISPOSED EQUALED 705.6 CUBIC"

WE HAD ABOUT 135 PSIG (265 PSIG MOP) ON THE LINE WHEN THE LEAK WAS DETECTED. WE IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE PRESSURE TEST AND ISOLATED THE LINE. AFTER INITIAL EXCAVATION, WE OBSERVED A SMALL LEAK COMING FROM AN UNDERGROUND FLANGE IN DNR-008. INSPECTION OF THE FLANGE GASKET MATERIAL SHOWS SIGNS OF DETERIORATION AND IS JUDGED TO BE THE CAUSE FOR THE UNDERGROUND LEAK.     NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE, AND WE WERE CONTACTED BY DANE GUIDRY OF LOUISIANA DNR. IN DISCUSSION WITH MR. GUIDRY, WE HAVE DETERMINED TO EXCAVATE ALL OTHER UNDERGROUND FLANGES ON THIS PIPELINE TO INSPECT, CUT OUT THE FLANGES AND THEN REPLACE WITIH WELDED SPOOL PIECES.

FOR ONE REASON BEING THAT ON THE DAY OF THE OIL SPILL SHEEN WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE FROM HIGH ISLAND S/T 60A AT THE TIME OF THE SPILL DURING CLEAN UP. I NOR ANY OF MY OPERATORS WERE TOLD OF ANY LOSS OF OIL OR POSSIBLE SPILLS BEFORE WE DISCOVERED THE PIPELINE LEAK ON NOVEMBER 16, 2006. ON TH EDAY OF THE SPILL WHEN IT WAS FOUND WE ONLY HAD ABOUT A  MILE SLICK COMING OFF THE BEACH. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A CONTINOUS SHEEN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT. ON THAT DAY WE HAD MAYBE 1FT. SEES AT THE MOST. I WENT OVER EVERY POSSIBLE REASON FOR THE LOSS OF OIL AND COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BESIDES BAD READING UNTIL I REMEMBERED THE WORK ON THE 16IN. CRUDE LINE ON 241 PLATFORM. I LOOKED BACK THROUGH THE LOGS AND FOUND THAT WE HAD ONE OF OUR OPERATORS ON THE BEACH ON NOVEMBER 10, 2006. I WAS OFFSHORE PREPARING TO PULL THE 16IN. PIG LAUNCHER OFF THE DEPARTING 16IN. L.P. PIPELINE. WE HAD PERVERSELY BEELD OFF ALL THE PRESSURE OFFSHORE ON THE 16IN. AND WAS TRYING TO LOWER THE FLUID LEVEL TO A SAFE LEVEL ON THE PIPELINE RISER TO PULL AND BLIND OFF THE PIPELINE TO DO A REPAIR ON A LOCKED OPEN 16IN. VALVE ON THE PIG LAUNCHER. I HAD A OPERATOR DRIVE DOWN THE OLD B.P. SHORE BASE TO POSSIBLY BLEED OFF ANY REMAINING PRESSURE ON THE INCOMING TIE-IN ON THE 16IN. PIPELING.I HAD HIM CLOSE THE INCOMING 4IN. LINE AND HE TRIED TO BLEED OFF ANY PRESSURE AT THAT POINT DUE TO IT BEING A OLD OUT OF SERVICE THREE PHASE LINE. AS SOON AS HE TRIED TO OPEN THE VENT HE HAD OIL. I THEN CALLED SHUT-IN BOTH DEPARTNING 4IN. LINES OFFSHORE AND I HAD HIM OPEN UP THE 16IN TIE-IN TO THE 6IN DEPARTING PIPELINES TO STAR LAKE TO SEE IF IT WOULD EQUALIZE TO PLAINS TANKS. I THEN HAD HIM GO BACK TO THE INCOMING 16IN. PIG RECEIVER AND I HAD HIM OPEN UP THE 8FT. BLOW DOWN ON THE TOP OF THE RECEIVER. OUR LEVEL STARTED DROPPING OUT ON OR RISER ON 241. WE DID THIS FOR AROUND 7  TO 8HR. BEFORE WE GOT THE LEVEL AT A SAFE HEIGHT TO PULL AND BLIND FLANGE THE LINE. I CAN NOT SAY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE NOT BACK FILLED THE 16IN. FROM THE OPEN 6IN. CRUDE LINE TO STAR LAKE. IT IS DEFINITELY A POSSIBLE WAY TO MISPLACE THE OIL IN QUESTION DUE TO THE HUGE VOID IN THE LINE FROM ALL THE WATER AND GAS THAT WE REMOVED. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THA TBEFORE AND AFTER THE JOB THEY DROVE DOWN TO WITH IN 40FT. OF THE FUTURE LEAK AND SAW NO SIGN OF ANY OIL ON THE BEACH OR IN THE WATER. IF THIS IS TRUE THAN ANY OIL THAT WAS LOST IS STILL SITTING IN THE 16IN. BLOCKED OFF LINE AND WILL BE RECOVERED WHEN IT IS PIGGED TO BE PUT BACK IN-SERVICE AS A L.P. CRUDE LINE. THAT WOULD BE THE EXPLANATION FOR THE LOSS OF OIL THAT NO ONE EVER FOUND.

HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD FOUND AN OIL LEAK ON OUR 4TH CRUDE PIPELINE DURING A PIPELINE SURVEY.  I HAD THEM FLY OUT TO HIGH ISLAND 24L A PLATFORM AND PICK ME UP.  I ARRIVED ON THE LOCATION AT 8:20 A.M...  WHEN I LANDED ON THE LOCATION I FOUND THAT THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM A HOLE ON THE BOTTOM OF OUR 4TH CRUDE LINE THAT HAD CAME IN CONTACT WITH N 8 IN. CROSSING PIPELINE.  THERE WAS A SLIGHT HAZE IN THE WATER SURROUNDING A POOL OF OIL CONTAINED ON THE BEACH.  I ESTIMATED A VOLUME OF 3 TO 5 BBLS.  I CONTACTED MIKE LUND AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SPILL.  I HAD HIM CLOSE THE DEPARTING 4 INCOMING LINE TO THE OLD B.P. SHORE BASE.  MIKE CALLED AND LET ME KNOW THAT HE HAD GOT A HOLD OF 55L AND THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT-IN.  I HAD MIKE CALL PLAINS MARKETING AND INFORM THEM OF THE SPILL AND TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED.  WE THEN CALLED GA RNER AND GAVE THEM THE LOCATION OF THE SPILL.  THEY INFORMED US THAT THEY WERE EN ROUTE TO THE LOCATION.  I THEN CALLED MIKE LUND AND HAD HIM CALL IN THE OIL SPILL DUE TO MY LOCATION AND BAD PHONE SERVICE.  I TRANSFERRED INFORMATION AND HAD HE CALL ALL AGENCIES.  I THEN WENT TO WORK TO TRY AND PREVENT ANY OIL FROM LEAKING OUT OF THE PIPELINE.  I WAS ABLE TO GET A TEMPORARY PATCH ON THE LINE AND WAS ABLE TO STOP THE LEAK.  WE THEN FLEW IN TOOLS AND OIL PADS TO HELP CONTAIN ANY OIL GETTING NEAR THE WATER.  WE HAD THE OIL CONTAINED FOR ABOUT 1  HRS. BEFORE THE HIGH TIDE STARTED COMING BACK IN AND BREAKING OUR CONTAINMENT.  GLO WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON SIGHT.  ONE OF THE GARNER TRUCKS ARRIVED BUT, THE TRUCK WITH THE BOOM WAS STUCK BEHIND A CAR STUCK IN THE ROAD.  THE OTHER TRUCK ARRIVED A SHORT TIME LATER AND A BOOM WAS LAUNCHED TO CONTAIN THE OIL BEING PULLED OUT INTO THE WATER.  WE LOST ABOUT A  BARREL OF OIL BEFORE THE BOOM WAS LAUNCHED.  GARNER WENT TO WORK TO CLEAN UP ALL THE CONTAINED OIL WITH OIL PADS.  WE THEN LAUNCHED A HELO.  WITH JASON FAJKUS ON BOARD AND DID A 10 MILE SEARCH BY AIR TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER PRODUCT IN THE WATER.  NO OTHER OIL WAS FOUND.  WE COMPLETED THE OIL CLEAN UP.  I WENT OVER THE SPILL WITH THE GLO, RRC, USCG AND THE WILDLIFE REFUGE PERSONNEL ON SITE.  I OFFERED FLIGHTS TO EVERYONE TO MAKE A SEARCH IF ANY WAS NEEDED TO CLOSE OUT THE SPILL.  EVERYONE DECLINED ANY FURTHER SEARCHES TO BE MADE.  DEAN WITH THE MCFADDEN WILDLIFE REFUGE INFORMED EVERYONE THAT HE WAS ON LOCATION THE DAY BEFORE, PARKED, WITH IN 50 FT. OF THE LEAK AND THAT IT WAS NOT THERE THE DAY BEFORE.  WE MADE THE CALL THAT IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED THE NIGHT BEFORE DUE TO A BAD STORM THAT HAD PASSED THROUGH.  ALL PAPER WORK WAS CLOSED OUT AND EVERYONE DEPARTED THE LOCATION.  STERLING PERSONNEL STAYED AROUND FOR 4 HRS., TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TEMPORARY PATCH HELD UP TO THE WAVE ACTION.  I WAS ABLE TO INSTALL AN 18 4 SPLIT SLEEVE CLAMP ON THE DAMAGED AREA ON NOVEMBER 19, 2006.  I THEN PRESSURE TESTED THE LINE FOR 24 HRS.  NO PRESSURE WAS LOST OR ANY PRODUCT AND THE LINE WAS PUT BACK IN-SERVICE UNTIL WE COULD DO A MORE EXTENSIVE REPAIR THAT WAS NEEDED TO PROPERLY FIX THE SITUATION.

MAC TAYLOR	6787622872	ATAYLORJ@COLPIPE.COM	6787622464	"ON DECEMBER 06, 2007, COLONIAL RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM A PROPERTY OWNER ON DRY CREEK VALLEY ROAD IN CHATTOOGA COUNTY GEORGIA CONCERNING THE PRESENCE OF PETROLEUM ODOR IN AN INACTIVE LIVESTOCK WELL.  LINES 18, 19, AND 20 ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE WELL AS ARE BLOCK VALVES ON LINES 18 AND 20.  RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED A SOURCE IN THE VICINITY OF THE LINE 18 BLOCK VALVE.  THE INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION IN GROUNDWATER AROUND THE WELL, PIPELINES, AND BLOCK VALVES.   THE BLOCK VALVE WAS EXCAVATED ON MARCH 24, 2008 AND EVIDENCE OF PRODUCT STAINING WAS FOUND AROUND A THREADED 1/2-INCH X 2-INCH NIPPLE LOCATED ON THE BODY OF THE VALVE.  LINE 18 WAS SHUT DOWN TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE AND TO REPLACE  THE NIPPLE.   THE NIPPLE WAS REMOVED AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A CRACK IN THE THREADS.  THE NIPPLE WAS REPLACED AND THE PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED.   IT APPEARED THAT  A LARGE AMOUNT OF FORCE PUSHING STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE RISER PIPE CAUSED THE NIPPLE TO CRACK.  THE SOURCE OF THE FORCE OR THE TIME OF OCCURANCE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. THE LINE 18 BLOCK VALVE AT DRY CREEK ROAD IS A 16-INCH DANIEL M303. THIS VALVE WAS PURCHASED WITH THE SECONDARY SEAT LUBRICATION/EMERGENCY SEALANT OPTION.  PRODUCT WOULD ONLY BE RELEASED FROM THE CRACKED NIPPLE IF THE VALVE SEATS DID NOT SEAL OR WHEN THE VALVE WAS OPERATED.  IT WAS DETERMINED IN THE FIELD THAT THE O-RINGS AND SEAT FACE SEALS WERE IN EXCELLENT WORKING ORDER AND PRODUCT WOULD ONLY BE RELEASED FROM THE CRACKED NIPPLE WHEN THE VALVE WAS OPERATED.  THE VALVE IS OPERATED 10% CLOSED EVERY SIX MONTHS FOR AN ESTIMATED TIME OF 2 TO 3 MINUTES.   THE GEORGIA EPD WAS FORMALLY NOTIFIED OF THE RELEASE ON MARCH 24TH, 2008 AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM (REPORT # 51477) UPON FINDING THE SOURCE OF  THE CONTAMINATION.  JIM GUENTERT WITH THE GA EPD WAS NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION ON DECEMBER 11, 2007 AS A COURTESY DUE TO THE CONFIRMED PRESENCE OF CONTAMINATION IN THE WELL, ALTHOUGH THE SOURCE AND RESPONSIBLE PARTY WAS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME.  BASED UPON THE INFORMATION GATHERED TO DATE, AN ESTIMATED 2 BARRELS OF GASOLINE, KEROSINE, AND FUEL OIL WERE RELEASED INTERMITTENTLY OVER AN UNKNOWN LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE CRACKED NIPPLE.  THE ACCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED TO THE NRC SINCE THE DAMAGES WERE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN $50,000 AND NO OTHER CRITERIA FOR AN NRC REPORT WAS MET.  SUBSEQUENT COST ESTIMATES FOR REMEDIATION WERE $70,000 BUT AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO EMERGENCY TO REPORT.  ACCESS TO THE SITE HAS BEEN DELAYED BY THE LANDOWNER. THE ACTUAL COST TO REMEDIATE WILL BE DETERMINED AS ADDITIONAL DATA IS GATHERED DURING FUTURE ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE SITE."

IMMEDIATELY, SUNOCO EMERGENCY RESPONSE PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND INTERESTED PARTIES IN LOCATING THE SOURCE OF THE SHEEN. AT APPROXIMATELY 15:00 18 MARCH SUNOCO DETERMINED THAT THE LIKELY SOURCE WAS ONE OF TWO UNDERGROUND PIPELINES THAT TRANSPORT PETROLEUM LIQUIDS BETWEEN THE TOLEDO REFINERY AND THE BARGE LOADING FACILITY (HOCKING VALLEY DOCK), ALSO OWNED BY SUNOCO. SUNOCO IMMEDIATELY TOOK ACTION TO STOP THE FLOW OF OIL TO OTTER CREEK. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDED: PLACING BOOM, SORBENT MATERIALS AND UNDERFLOW DAMS AT WHEELING AND SEAMAN STREETS AND AT OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE OIL COULD BE CONTAINED, DIGGING SUMPS TO CONTAIN THE OIL AT THE PRIMARY SPILL SITE AND VACUUMING UP THE FREE PRODUCT. BECAUSE THE LEAK SITE WAS WET WITH STANDING WATER, SUNOCO BUILT A 1/4 MILE GRAVEL ROAD IN TO THE AREA TO BEGIN EXCAVATING THE LINES. AFTER EXCAVATION, THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE 8: LINE. THIS LINE TRANSPORTED LIGHT CYCLE OIL, A DIESEL TYPE MATERIAL, TO THE BARGE FACILITY. THE LEAK WAS EXPOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 20 MARCH AND THE RELEASE STOPPED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE LINE WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPAIRED BY 22 MARCH.    --------------  AUGUST 5, 2009    THE 8"" PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON APRIL 25 2008.  A FORENSIC INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED ON THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE BY KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES, INC.  THE FAILURE WAS FOUND TO BE LOCATED AT A CIRCUMFERENTIALLY ORIENTED CRACK ADJACENT TO A GIRTH WELD JOINING A LENGTH OF LINE PIPE TO A TRIMMED ELBOW FITTING.  THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY FATIGUE RESULTING FROM THERMAL EXPANSION AS THE PIPELINE WAS CYCLED BETWEEN NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE AND AMBIENT GROUND TEMPERATURE DURING IDLE PERIODS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE  FORENSIC INSPECTION REPORT, THE PIPELINE WAS IDLED BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 26 2008.  A PIPING FLEXIBILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE ENTIRE PIPELINE WAS PERFORMED BY THE EQUITY ENGINEERING GROUP, INC. (E2G) WHICH IDENTIFIED THERMAL EXPANSION STRESSES AT BENDS, CONSISTENT WITH THE FINDINGS BY KIEFNER.   IN ADDITION,  A NEW TEMPERATURE LIMIT WAS ESTABLISHED  BASED ON THE PIPING FLEXIBILITY ASSESSMENT RESULTS .  IN ACCORDANCE WITH E2G RECOMMENDATIONS, EIGHT BENDS WERE REPLACED TO REDUCE STRESS LEVELS RELATED TO THERMAL CYCLING AND A NEW HEAT EXCHANGER (COOLER) WAS INSTALLED AT 15 PUMPHOUSE.  AN IN-LINE INSPECTION (ILI) AND A HYDROSTATIC TEST WERE ALSO CONDUCTED, SEVERAL CORROSION AND DEFORMATION FEATURES WERE IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED, AND THE LINE WAS SUCCESSFULLY RETURNED TO SERVICE ON JULY 15 2009."

THE OPERATORS NOTIFIED THEIR SUPERVISOR WHO THEN STARTED THE NOTIFICATION CHAIN.  REGION 1 PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO ASSIST IN THE EVALUATION OF THE REPORTED SOIL STAINING.    FIELD INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PRODUCT THAT WAS STAINING THE SOIL WAS CONDUCTED ON THE EVENING OF 4/25/2008 BETWEEN 7:00 PM AND MIDNIGHT. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:05 PM, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE 8"" PIPING SECTION 864 THAT RAN FROM TANK 328, ACROSS THE DIKE FIELD, UNDER THE DIKE WALL AN INTO THE L4 MANIFOLD AREA WAS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THE LEAKING PRODUCT. THE PIPING SECTION WAS ISOLATED WITH VALVES AND PLANS MADE TO RETURN THE NEXT DAY TO FURTHER EVALUATE AND ISOLATE THIS SECTION. ON SATURDAY, 4/26/2008, COMPANY PIPELINERS, MECHANIC, OPERATIONS AND OSROS VACUUM TRUCK IMPLEMENTED A WORK PLAN TO LOTO THE MANIFOLD AND TANK VALVES SO THAT THE 864 LINE COULD BE EVACUATED. ONCE THE 864 LINE WAS DETERMINED TO BE CLEAR AND LIQUID-FREE, THE PIPING WAS PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED FROM THE TANK 328 AND BLIND FLANGES USED TO ISOLATE THE PIPE AND VALVES.    INVESTIGATION INTO CAUSE DETERMINED THAT THE LINE THAT LEAKED HAD BEEN HISTORICALLY OOS BY BLINDING.  THE TANK WAS TAKEN OOS FOR MAINTENANCE WORK AND BLINDS REMOVED.  UPON PLACING THE TANK BACK INTO SERVICE, THE BLINDS WERE NOT REINSTALLED.  EVEN THOUGH VALVES WERE CLOSED, THE VALVES LEAKED THROUGH INTERNALLY ALLOWING THE PRODUCT TO ENTER THE OOS LINE WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS THROUGH WALL FEATURES."

OPERATIONS PERSONNEL DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION SMELLED AN ODOR BUT DID NOT DETECT GAS WITH A GAS DETECTOR.  ALL PRODUCT LINES AT THE LOCATION WERE BLOCKED IN FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE CALLED NRC (#872636) ESTIMATING A SMALL VOLUME RELEASE OF 1 BARREL PRIOR TO LOCATING THE LEAK.  EXCAVATION LOCATED A SMALL LEAK NEAR A ROAD CROSSING. AFTER REMOVING A BELOW GROUND ICE BALL, A SECOND CALL WAS MADE TO NRC (#872718) WITH A REVISED VOLUME ESTIMATE OF 2 BARRELS.    THE LEAK WAS STOPPED WITH A PLIDCO SLEEVE, BUT AFTER THE SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED, A SMALL CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK CLUSTER WAS DISCOVERED APPROXIMATELY 6"" FROM THE PLIDCO SLEEVE AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THE OPERATING PRESSURE WAS TEMPORARILY REDUCED 20% AND APPROXIMATELY 100' OF PIPE WAS EXCAVATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LEAK SITE TO EXAMINE THE PIPE FOR ADDITIONAL DEFECTS.  NO ADDITIONAL DEFECTS WERE FOUND.  STOPPLES WERE SET, AND THE LEAK AND CRACK CLUSTER WERE CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH PIPE OF THE SAME DIAMETER, WALL THICKNESS, AND GRADE.  THE LINE WAS THEN RETURNED TO SERVICE.    THE DEFECTIVE PIPE SEGMENT WAS SENT TO STORK METALLURGICAL CONSULTANTS IN HOUSTON FOR ANALYSIS.  THE LEAK WAS LOCATED IN A SMALL CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK.  ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE CRACKS WERE CAUSED BY STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING AND THAT ORIENTATION OF THE CRACKS IMPLICATED A BENDING LOAD.    DURING JUNE 2010, A SOIL AND GROUNDWATER DELINEATION INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREEMENTS ESTABLISHED WITH KDHE.

THE MIDFIELD TERMINAL RECEIVES PRODUCT FROM THE TIOGA PIPELINE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE BUCKEYE PIPELINE WHICH ORIGINATES FROM BUCKEYES CORAOPOLIS TERMINAL.   COMMUNICATION WAS LOST BETWEEN MIDFIELDS BUCKEYES PLC AND BUCKEYES CORAOPOLIS TERMINALS PLC WHICH ALLOWED BUCKEYES PUMP TO CONTINUE RUNNING AND BUILDING PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE UNTIL THE RELIEF VALVE WAS ACTIVATED AT MIDFIELD CAUSING AN OVERFLOW OF THE RELIEF TANK.  THE PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE OR TERMINAL PIPING NEVER EXCEEDED THE MOP OF THE PIPING.  AT 1935 HOURS THE BUCKEYE CORAOPOLIS CONTROLLER RECEIVED MULTIPLE AIRPORT SYSTEM COMMUNICATION FAILURE ALARMS.  WHEN THE ALARM DID NOT CLEAR THE BUCKEYE CONTROLLER CALLED BUCKEYES BREINIGSVILLE CONTROL CENTER WHO TRIED PINGING MIDFIELD TO RE-ESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS.  THIS ATTEMPT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE DECISION TO SHUT DOWN THE AIRPORT SYSTEM WAS MADE AT 1949 HOURS.  THE CORAOPOLIS CONTROLLER CONTACTED AN ASI (AIRPORT) EMPLOYEE AT MIDFIELD TO NOTIFY THEM THAT THE LINE WAS SHUT DOWN.    AT 2105 HOURS THE ASI EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED THE CORAOPOLIS CONTROLLER THAT THE RELIEF TANK WAS FULL AND THAT A POSSIBLE OVERFILL FILL ON THE RELIEF TANK MAY HAVE OCCURRED.  WITH THE HEAVY RAIN IN THE AREA IT WAS HARD TO DETERMINE IF PRODUCT WAS ON THE PAD OR NOT.  AT 2107 HOURS BUCKEYES LOCAL SUPERVISION WAS NOTIFIED AND HE IMMEDIATELY ACTIVATED BUCKEYES EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND A CREW WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  ON ARRIVAL IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RELIEF TANK DID OVERFLOW.  ALL APPROPRIATE OUTSIDE AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED OF THE RELEASE.  BUCKEYES CREW AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR IMMEDIATELY STARTED CLEAN UP OPERATIONS.  DUE TO EXPECTED HEAVY RAINS IN THE AREA, BUCKEYES EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR REMAINED ON SITE THROUGH THE NIGHT TO ENSURE NO RUN OFF OF PRODUCT WOULD OCCUR.  ALL CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETED AND A NEW UPS SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED AT MIDFIELD BY BUCKEYE.  BUCKEYE ALSO MADE UPGRADES TO THE AIRPORT PUMP AT BUCKEYES CORAOPOLIS TERMINAL SO THAT IT WILL SHUT DOWN AUTOMATICALLY AFTER THREE MINUTES OF CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION FAILURE."

BOOMS WERE INSTALLED IN THE POND SPILLWAY TO STOP OIL IN CASE OF HEAVY RAIN FILLING POND. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS, SKIMMING WAS COMPLETE AND RESIDUAL OIL WAS BURNED AND ABSORBANT PUT ON THE POND TO PICK UP ANY OIL THAT WAS LEFT.  INTERNAL CORROSION WAS FOUND AT THE LEAK SIGHT ON THE PIPE WHICH WAS CLAMPED AND FENCED AWAITING PERMANENT REPAIR. POND WATER WAS SAMPLED AFTER OIL WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO BE TESTED.

ALL PRODUCT WAS REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION. 262 GALLONS OF DIESEL WAS PUT IN THE SUMP AND SOIL ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT TO THE SOIL.  GROUNDWATER WAS NOT IMPACTED BY THE RELEASE.  THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONFINED TO THE EXCAVATION AND CONTAINED WITHIN THE FACILITY.  BASED ON A REVIEW BY THE DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS WERE REQUIRED.    THE STATION WAS DRAINED AND REPAIRS TO THE CHECK VALVE WERE STARTED.  BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGED CONDITION OF THE PACKING , A DECISION WAS MADE TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE PACKING GLAND.  UPON REMOVAL OF THE PACKING GLAND, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BUSHING HAD MOVED FROM THE PACKING GLAND CAUSING THE SHAFT TO RIDE ON THE PACKING.

WE WITNESSED NO PRESSURE INCREASES NOR RATE LOSS FROM THE SITUATION BUT MADE PLANS TO REMOVE THE PIGS AND ASSESS WHY THE FIRST PIG BECAME LODGED IN THE VALVE.  CALCULATIONS USING THE ELEVATIONS AND PIPE SIZE INDICATED WE WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY 400 BARRELS OF DRAIN UP TO THE NORTH OF THE VALVE TO ENABLE THE VALVE TO BE REMOVED SAFELY.  WE HAD VAC'ED 320 BARRELS OF OIL FROM THE LINE WHEN THE FLOW RATE DWINDLED CONSIDERABLY.  AT THAT POINT, WE REMOVED A COVER ON THE CHECK VALVE DOWNSTREAM OF THE AFFECTED VALVE TO DISCOVER THERE WAS ABOUT 1"" TO 1 1/4"" OF OIL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE AND FLOW FROM THE AFFECTED VALVE WAS VERY SLOW.  WE CONSTRUCTED A BELL HOLE UNDER THE VALVE, LINED IT WITH A NEW 50 MIL PIT LINER AND PROCEEDED TO REMOVE A SHORT SECTION OF FLANGED PIPING BETWEEN THE DOWNSTREAM CHECK VALVE AND THE STUCK PIG LOCATION.  DOING SO WAS GOING TO ALLOW US ACCESS TO THE STUCK PIGS AND WE THOUGHT WE COULD PULL THEM OUT WITHOUT REMOVING THE VALVE FROM THE LINE.  WE HAD TWO EMPTY 80 BARREL VAC TRUCKS WITH HOSES READY TO REMOVE OIL FROM THE CATCH BASIN WE HAD CONSTRUCTED.  AFTER ACCESSING THE PIGS FROM THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE VALVE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE THEM BY PRYING OR PULLING WITH A CHAIN AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VALVE HAD TO BE REMOVED SO THE PIGS COULD BE EXTRACTED WITHOUT DAMAGING THE VALVE.  WHEN WE UNBOLTED THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE BLOCK VALVE THERE WAS A WALL OF OIL TRAPPED BEHIND THE SECOND PIG THAT RAN OVER OUR CATCH BASIN AND SETTLED IN THE ADJACENT LOW SPOTS OUTSIDE OF OUR PIT LINED AREA.  WE ESTIMATED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE RELEASE THAT APPROXIMATELY 80 BARRELS COULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BUT EMPLOYEES AND VAC TRUCK DRIVERS DIDN'T FEEL THERE WERE MORE THAN 60 TO 65 BARRELS RELEASED ONCE THE VALVE WAS REMOVED AND WE PICKED UP JUST OVER 50 FROM THE CLEANUP.  THE TRUCKS WERE PICKING THE OIL UP AS IT RAN FROM THE CATCH BASIN TO THE LOWER AREAS."

AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY INCOMING DELIVERY LINES NO. 1,2,3 AND 4 WERE SHUT DOWN, AND THE RELIEF LINE SERVICING THE TERMINAL WAS ISOLATED.  PERSONNEL WAS IMMEDIATELY MOBILIZED TO SECURE THE AREA, INITATE INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP THE SITE.  THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, PHMSA AND WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES WERE NOTIFIED.  FREE PRODUCT WAS COLLECTED AND APPROXIMATELY 108 BARRELS WERE RECOVERED (FROM THE 115 BBLS RELEASED).  THE REMAINING VOLUME OF OIL ABSORBED INTO THE SURROUNDING SOIL.  THE CONTAMINATED SOIL (CLAY) WAS EXCAVATED AND 500 YARDS OF MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE FOR TREATMENT/DISPOSAL AT A LICENCED FACILITY.      UPON INVESTIGATION THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED TO ORIGINATE FROM THE 24-INCH TANK 9 RELIEF LINE.  THE LEAK WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 95 FEET NORTHWEST FROM VALVE 301-V-921 WITHIN THE TANK LOT.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE LINE PRESSURE WAS LESS THAN 30 PSI.  UPON INITIAL ASSESSMENT THE SUSPECTED CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS INTERNAL CORROSION AT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PIPE (SIX O'CLOCK POSITION).  THE LINE WAS CLEANED AND REPAIRED USING A 24-INCH PLIDCO SPILT +SLEEVE AND RETURNED TO SERVICE.  ALL INCOMING DELIVERY LINES TO THE TERMINAL WERE RESTARTED BY 8:00 PM CENTRAL TIME (7:00 PM MST), AUGUST 25, 2008.    FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT    AN APPROXIMATE 20 FOOT SECTION OF PIPE AROUND THE LEAK SITE WAS EXCAVATED, CLEANED AND ULTRASONICALLY TESTED (C-SCAN) BY A THIRD-PARTY TESTING COMPANY ON AUGUST 28, 2008.  ADDITIONAL CORROSION FEATURES WERE FOUND WITHIN THIS TEST SECTION, HOWEVER THESE CORROSION ANOMOLIES ARE WITHIN ENBRIDGE CORROSION TOLERANCES AND DO NOT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REPAIR AND THE LINE REMAINS ""FIT FOR DUTY"".  THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS FOR THIS RELIEF LINE WILL BE FURTHER EVALUATED BY ENBRIDGE AND INCORPORATED INTO THE STATION PIPING PROGRAM AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR SYSTEM INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT."

A CPM LEAK ALARM FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER AND THE WABASH SYSTEM WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN. SHUTDOWN OF THE SYSTEM WAS INITIATED 36 SECONDS AFTER CPM ALARM AND FLOW WAS STOPPED 11 SECONDS LATER. THE WABASH EXPERIENCED A FAILURE 100 YARDS DOWNSTREAM OF ASHMORE STATION.  THE LINE WAS TURNED FROM CHAMPAIGN TO HAMMOND IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO FAILURE.  ANALYSIS OF THE PIPE REVEALED THAT THE FAILURE MECHANISM WAS A DEFORMATION ANOMALY THAT WAS CENTERED ADJACENT TO THE LONGITUDINAL ERW SEAM WITH A SHEAR CRACK THAT FORMED ON THE OUTSIDE DIAMTER OF THE PIPE DUE TO RE-ROUNDING OF THE DEFORMATION.    A LONGITUDINAL SEAM SPLIT DID OCCUR, AND WAS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE VOLUME RELEASED; HOWEVER, THE SEAM SPLIT WAS SECONDARY TO THE DEFORMATION ANOMALY CENTERED ADJACENT TO THE LONGITUDINAL ERW SEAM. A REVISED FINAL REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED THIS 23RD DAY OF MARCH, 2010 CHANGING THE CAUSE FROM MISCELLANEOUS TO RUPTURE, LONGITUDINAL SEAM SPLIT.     THE DEFORMATION IS BELIEVED TO HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE ORIGINAL COMMISSIONING HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST. THEREFORE, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT WAS SELECTED THOUGH NEITHER OPTION AVAILABLE IS TRULY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SITUATION. POOR WORKMANSHIP WAS SELECTED AS THE SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION DEFECT SINCE THE DEFORMATION OCCURRED DURING THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION AND THE CRACKING PROPAGATION OCCURRED FROM REROUNDING DURING HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TESTS.     BECAUSE THIS REPORTING FORM DOES NOT ALLOW FOR REPORTING OF MINUTES IN QUESTION G3, THE DATA HAS BEEN INPUT AS LEAK DURATION OF 1 HOUR.  HOWEVER, AS NOTED IN THIS NARRATIVE, THE LINE WAS SHUTDOWN UPON THE ALARM SIGNALING A FAILURE. WATER CONTAMINATION IS ESTIMATED AT LESS THAN A BARREL, BUT DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE FORM, IT IS LOGGED AS 1 BARREL. RUPTURE PROPOGATION LENGTH WAS DETERMINED TO BE 70 INCHES, WHICH IS 5.8 FEET. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE FORM, PROPOGATION LENGTH WAS ROUNDED UP TO 6 FEET.  MARATHON REPORTED A SECOND NRC REPORT (#882650) UPDATING SPILL VOLUME."

THE OPERATION MANAGER CALLED NJDEP TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 PM AND WAS GIVEN CASE # 081003-1204-42 BY OPERATOR 33.  THE DISTRICT EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION WAS INITIATED AND RESPONSE EFFORTS WERE STARTED.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS CONTINUED FROM FRIDAY OCTOBER 3RD THROUGH MONDAY OCTOBER 6TH.  THE RELEASED WAS CAUSED BY A GEO-PROBE SUBCONTRACTOR WORKING FOR THE ENGINEERING FIRM HANDLING THE NEW JERSEY TURPIKE AUTHORITY'S WIDENING PROJECT.  THE CONTRACTOR WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO PROBE IN COLONIAL PIPELINE'S ROW.  THE PLANNED PROBE LOCATION WAS 40 FEET OUTSIDE OF COLONIAL'S ROW.  THE SURVEYOR'S STAKE FOR THE APPROVED LOCATION OF THE PROBE LOCATION WAS VISABLE FROM THE LEAK SITE.  THERE WAS NO ACTIVE ONECALL FOR THE WORK THE CONTRACTOR WAS PERFORMING.  THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED BY PUTTING A TYPE B STEEL SLEEVE ON SLEEVE OVER THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPELINE.    TO DATE 1372.80 TONS OF SOIL HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SITE AND SENT TO BE RECYCLED .  AT THIS TIME NO MORE SOIL IS ANTICIPATED TO BE REMOVED.  THE SITE HAS BEEN BACKFILLED, GRADED AND ROAD RESTORED TO SERVICE FOR THE LAND OWNER.

WHEN THE GROUNDBED IS CONNECTED CORRECTLY THE CURRENT WILL FLOW FROM THE ANODES TO THE PIPELINE AND IF THE CURRENT FLOW IS TOO HIGH COATING DAMAGE WILL RESULT, HOWEVER THE PIPE ITSELF WILL DEVELOP HEAVY MINERAL DEPOSIT (AS SEEN ON THE 10"" PIPELINE) AND WILL NOT BE DAMAGED UNLESS THE CURRENT FLOW IS SO HIGH THAT IT CAUSES EMBRITTLEMENT FROM THE FORMATION OF HYDROGEN.  WHEN THE ANODES ARE REVERSED (NEGATIVE TO THE PIPING) THE CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM THE PIPING AND TANK AND TRYING TO RETURN TO THE ANODES TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT - SINCE OUR PIPELINE SERVES AS A PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE IT WILL PICK UP A LOT OF THIS CURRENT AND RETURN IT TO THE ANODES CLOSEST TO THE PIPELINE.     4/20/2010 -- REPORT UPDATED PER RESULTS OF LEAK REVIEW SPRING 2010.

UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION, TWO BROKEN CAP SCREWS WERE FOUND ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE FLANGE ON THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE SOURCE VALVE.  THE CAP SCREWS ARE  X 2 LONG PFC^9 WITH 180,000 PSI TENSILE STRENGTH.  THIS VALVE IS AN 8 INCH 150 # CLASS, GENERAL TWIN SEAL REDUCED PORT WITH 8 BOLTS ON THE FLANGE AND IT HAS A 7 FOOT LONG OPERATOR EXTENSION. IT IS APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET DEEP.  THE TOP TWO AND BOTTOM TWO BOLT HOLES ON THE FLANGE AND VALVE ARE JOINED WITH CAP SCREWS. THE SIDE PORTS ARE STUDS AND NUTS.   THE VALVE AND WAFER CHECK VALVE WERE REMOVED, THE BROKEN CAP SCREW ENDS WERE REMOVED FROM THE VALVE BODY, AND THE VALVE REINSERTED WITH NEW CAP SCREWS ON THE SUCTION SIDE BY 0800 ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2008. THIS IS A PERMANENT REPAIR.  THE SYSTEM WAS TESTED AND IS CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LEAK IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  PRODUCT RECOVERY OPERATIONS COMMENCED IMMEDIATELY AT THE MAINTENANCE EXCAVATION WHERE PRODUCT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED AND FROM THE TANK VALVE EXCAVATION VIA HAND BAILING AND VACUUM TRUCK.  PRODUCT RECOVERY OPERATIONS CONTINUED THROUGH FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21 WHEN PRODUCT RECOVERY AMOUNTS DECLINED TO MINIMAL AMOUNTS.  A TOTAL OF APPROX. 167 BARRELS OF FREE PRODUCT WERE RECOVERED. AN ESTIMATED 2 BARRELS OF PRODUCT WERE CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXCAVATED SOIL. THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED TO THE MANIFOLD AREA AND DID NOT REACH THE STATION OIL/WATER SEPARATOR OR FACILITY PONDS. ROOT CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE OVERSTRESS OF BOLTS ON FLANGE CONNECTION."

IT APPEARS THAT A ROAD GRADER GRADING THE DITCH AREA AT THE PIPELINE CROSSING SCRAPPED THE PIPELINE, LEAVING THREE DENTS AND GOUGES ON THE PIPELINE.    THE RELEASE WAS FROM A FINE VERTICAL CRACK IN ONE OF THE DENTS WHICH CAUSED A SPRAY OF OIL FROM THE PIPELINE.  A REVIEW OF THE COMTROL ROOM DATA DID NOT INDICATE ANY CHANGES IN PRESSURE TO INDICATE THAT A RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL HAD OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE SMALL LEAK RATE FROM THE SMALL VERTICAL CRACK.  THE RELEASE WAS REPORTED TO THE CONTROL CENTER BY A THIRD PARTY.  THE FAILED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE IS BEING SENT TO A LABOARATORY FOR AN ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.  A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED AFTER RECEIPT OF THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS REPORT.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.  THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS IN REPORT NO. 0129-09-18891 BY STORK TESTING & METALLURGICAL CONSULTING, INC. DATED MARCH 6, 2009, STATE THAT ""THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY MECHANICAL DAMAGE IN THE FORM OF A DENT AND GOUGE"".  IT ALSO STATES: ""SHALLOW CRACKS THAT SLANTED AWAY FROM THE GOUGES RESULTED FROM THE ELASTIC SPRINGBACK OF THE STEEL.  AT THE GOUGE THAT EVENTUALLY LEAKED, THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF CRACK EXTENSION BY FATIGUE, WHICH PRECEDED THE FINAL BRITTLE FRACTURE OF THE PIPE AND CONSEQUENT LEAK.""  THE REPORT SUPPORTS OUR ORIGINAL STATEMENT THAT IT APPEARS THAT A ROAD GRADER  GRADING THE DITCH AREA AT THE PIPELINE ROAD CROSSING SCRAPPED/GOUGED THE LINE.  SINCE THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF CRACK EXTENSION BY FATIGUE, IT INDICATES THAT THE LEAK DID NOT OCCUR IMMEDIATELY BUT AT SOMETIME (DEPENDING UPON SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE CYCLING) AFTER THE HIGH RESOLUTION MAGNETIC FLUX TOOL RUN IN 2005.  THE METALLURGICAL REPORT WAS SENT TO CHRIS MCCLAREN WITH THE SOUTHWEST REGION OF PHMSA ON MARCH 11, 2009."

AT 04:28 A HIGH TANK ALARM WAS RECEIVED ON TANK 211.  VISUAL ALARMS WERE RECEIVED ON BOTH THE ANNUNCIATOR PANEL AND THE SAAB.  PER THE OPERATOR ON DUTY, NO AUDIBLE ALARMS WERE RECEIVED ON EITHER SYSTEM.  NEITHER VISUAL ALARM WAS RESPONDED TO BY THE OPERATOR AT THIS TIME.  THE OPERATOR WENT TO THE SAMPLE HOUSE, AND UPON RETURNING TO THE CONTROL ROOM, THE OPERATOR OBSERVED THAT THE ANNUNCIATOR ALARM FOR TANK 211 WAS ILLUMINATED.  OPERATOR VERIFIED THE ANNUNCIATOR ALARM AGAINST THE SAAB TANK ALARM.  THE OPERATOR THEN SET UP A NEW TANK ON THE TANK SELECT AND CUT TO TANK 214.  AT 06:05, OPERATOR STARTED TRANSFER SYSTEM TO MOVE PRODUCT FROM TANK 211 TO 214.  OPERATOR DID VISUAL INSPECTION ON TANK 211 AND VERIFIED TANK OVER FLOW HAD OCCURRED.  OPERATOR THEN NOTIFIED LEAD OPERATOR AT 06:15.  SUBSEQUENT NOTIFICATIONS WERE THEN MADE TO THE OPERATIONS MANAGER, DISTRICT LEADER, AND DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER.  THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED TO THE TANK DIKE AREA WITHIN FOUR DISCRETE AREAS ADJACENT TO THE TANK.  A CONTRACTOR CREW WAS CALLED TO ASSIST WITH CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AND PRODUCT RECOVERY OPERATIONS BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 09:00 FROM TWO SMALL POOLS OF PRODUCT ADJACENT TO THE TANK.  IMPACTED AREAS AROUND THE TANK WERE DELINEATED AND PRODUCT RECOVERY SUMP HOLES WERE EXCAVATED ADJACENT TO THE TANK.  FREE PRODUCT RECOVERY OPERATIONS VIA HAND BAILING AND VAC TRUCK CONTINUED THROUGH 11/23/08 FROM THE EXCAVATED SUMP HOLES WITH THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT RECOVERED BY THE AFTERNOON OF 11/21/08.  APPROXIMATELY 600 TONS OF IMPACTED SOILS WERE EXCAVATED AND STOCKPILED FOR DISPOSAL DURING THE PERIOD OF 11/21/08 THROUGH 12/2/08.  THE MAJORITY OF IMPACTED SOILS WERE REMOVED DURING THE EXCAVATION PROCESS.  DUE TO THE IMPERVIOUS NATURE OF SOILS UNDERLYING THE TANK DIKE, GROUNDWATER IMPACTS FROM THE RELEASE WERE MINIMAL.  THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE TANK DIKE AREA AND SURFACE WATER WAS NOT IMPACTED.  NOTIFICATION OF THE RELEASE WAS MADE TO ADEM (CARY SPIEGEL - HYDROGEOLOGY SECTION, GROUNDWATER BRANCH, LAND DIVISION) AT 12:40 ON 11/20/08.  NO FUTURE REMEDIAL ACTIONS OTHER THAN MONITORING ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.  THE RELEASE AMOUNT ESTIMATE, 364 GALLONS, IS BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF FREE PRODUCT RECOVERED (230 GALLONS), THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT CONTAINED WITHIN IMPACTED SOILS (113 GALLONS), AND THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT LOST TO EVAPORATION (21 GALLONS).  AT THE TIME THE OPERATOR LOSSES WERE ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $50,000 THE EMERGENCY WAS OVER, THEREFORE AN NRC TELEPHONIC NOTICE WAS NOT MADE."

COLLINS MISSISSIPPI PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 15:00 CST AND ARRIVED IN THE AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 17:00 CST, GROUND INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUED UNTIL DARKNESS AND RESUMED AGAIN ON THE MORNING OF 12-31-08, AND AT 10:50 CST THE RIGHT-OF-WAY INSPECTOR NOTIFIED THE COLONIAL CONTROL CENTER OF THE POTENTIAL LINE-7 LEAK BASED ON THEIR OBSERVATION OF A SHEEN COVERING AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 5-FEET BY 10-FEET ON THE WATER SURFACE WITHIN OUR RIGHT-OF-WAY AND ABOVE OUR PIPELINE. THE PIPELINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN BY THE CONTROL CENTER  FOLLOWING THEIR ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES. THE INSPECTOR THEN NOTIFIED THE MISSISSIPPI AREA OPERATIONS MANAGER OF THE SITUATION AT 10:51CST AND FOLLOWING THAT NOTIFICATION, THE OPERATIONS MANAGER MADE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER AT 10:55 CST, DISTRICT PROJECT LEADER AT 10:58 CST AND THE DISTRICT LEADER AT 11:02 CST. AT 11:10 OIL SPILL RESPONSE CONTRACTOR WAS NOTIFIED AND DISPATCHED. THE PIPELINE WAS INITIALLY BLOCKED BY THE CONTROL CENTER USING REMOTELY OPERATED VALVES AT STATION LOCATIONS12+65 AND 2080+81. MANUAL UPSTREAM ISOLATION VALVE STATION 123+18 WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED AT 13:00 CST AND THE MANUAL DOWNSTREAM ISOLATION VALVE STATION 821+66 WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED AT 13:27 CST.     THE MSDEQ WAS NOTIFIED ON 12-31-08 AT 11:45 CST AND THE NRC NOTIFICATION WAS COMPLETED AT 12:30 CST ON 12-31-08, REPORT # 893748. ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE DMR AND ACOE WITH CONFIRMATIONS RECEIVED FROM BOTH AGENCIES ON 1-5-09.     THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF PRODUCT RELEASED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM WAS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN 1-GALLON TO SURFACE WATER. THE SOIL REMOVED FROM AROUND THE PIPELINE DURING EXCAVATION WAS EXAMINED WITH DEQ INVOLVEMENT AND DETERMINED TO HAVE NO CONTAMINATION FROM PRODUCT CONTACT. THE PRODUCT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SURFACE WATER BY NATURAL EVAPORATION.            THE PIPELINE ANOMALY WAS IDENTIFIED AS A LONGITUDINAL CRACK - 1.5"" LONG AND REPAIRED USING A PLIDCO SPLIT BOLT ON SLEEVE AND THE PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED ON 1-6-09 AT 21:11 CST. THE PIPE SECTION CONTAINING THE CRACK AND REPAIR SLEEVE WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED ON 01-30-09.     THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS AND GPS COORDINATES WERE REVISED ON JULY 13, 2011 FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY FROM PHMSA ON MAY 18, 2011 REGARDING THE HIGH COSTS RELATIVE TO THE SMALL VOLUME SPILLED.  THE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR OPERATOR DAMAGES INCORRECTLY INCLUDED THE COST OF REPLACING THE SECTION OF LINE PIPE FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL REPAIR USING A FULL ENCIRCLEMENT SLEEVE. THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE, OPERATOR PROPERTY DAMAGES AND PRODUCT LOSSES WERE $870,341."

DURING THIS PROCESS A SMELL OF GASOLINE WAS DETECTED AND THE REMOVAL OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF DIRT INDICATED THAT A RELEASE OF GASOLINE HAD OCCURRED FROM THE PIPELINE.  THE PLAINS CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR IMMEDIATELY HAD THE LINE SHUTDOWN AND CLOSED TWO MANUAL BLOCK VALVES TO ISOLATE THIS SEGMENT OF THE PIPELINE.  AFTER REMOVING THE SOIL FROM THE PIPELINE, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT A RELEASE OF GASOLINE HAD OCCURRED FROM THE PIPELINE DUE TO A PINHOLE IN THE PIPELINE CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION.    THE INITIAL FIELD ASSESMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COSTS WOULD NOT EXCEED THE TELEPHONIC REPORTING THRESHOLD OF $50,000.  IT HAS NOW BEEN DETERMINED BY OUR REMEDIATION DEPARTMENT THAT THE GASOLINE SPILL HAS REACHED THE GROUNDWATER WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 25 FEET DEEP.  CLEANUP HAS BEEN SLOWED DUE TO WEATHER AND A FINAL ESTIMATED COST CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.  OUR BEST CURRENT ESTIMATE IS A FINAL COST OF $245,880.    12/9/09.  THIS IS A FINAL REPORT.  BASED UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE SOIL REMEDIATION AND DELINEATION OF THE GROUNDWATER IMPACT, A FIRM AND FINAL ESTIMATED COST TO COMPLETE THE MITIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IS $565,400.  ALSO, DURING REMEDIATION, 30 BARRELS OF PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT SPILLED IS NOW APPROXIMATELY 100 BARRELS WITH AN ESTIMATED LEAK DURATION OF 5 DAYS AND 12 HOURS (WHICH WAS ESTIMATED WITH AN AVERAGE PINHOLE SIZE OF 1/24"" DIAMETER."

THIS ELECTRONIC REPORT DOES NOT ALLOW THE OPERATOR TO CHECK INDEFINITE IN PART C.    CONTROLLER DISCOVERED PRESSURE DROP AND STARTED THE SHUTTING DOWN THE PIPELINE. CONTROLLER STARTED NOTIFICATIONS. THE FAILED SEGMENT HAS BEEN SENT TO BE ANALYZED.   NORMAL OPERATING SCENARIO:   1. APPROXIMATELY 8 HOURS BEFORE A SCHEDULE START UP OF THE TWO DIFFERENT RECEIPTS AT REDWASH A PREHEAT IS EXECUTED.  2. VALVES AT REDWASH OPEN ALLOWING LIGHT CRUDE FROM MAINLINE TO FLOW THROUGH REDWASH STATION VIA A 3 AND 4 7MI LATERAL.   3. THE LIGHT CRUDE COMES INTO THE STATION AND THROUGH THE HEATERS AND BACK DOWN THE 6 TO THE MAINLINE TO WARM THE LINE UP.   4. ONCE THE TEMPERATURE AT END OF THE 6 LATERAL AT MAINLINE REACHES 75 DEGREES THEN REDWASH INJECTIONS ARE STARTED WHICH CLOSES THE 3 & 4 LATERALS AT REDWASH. THIS LEAVES THE LATERALS AS HAVING STANDING MAINLINE PRESSURE ON LATERALS ALL THE TIME.    THIS SEGMENT PIPELINE HAS BEEN SHUTDOWN INDEFINITELY.

THE PIPELINE CONTROLLER WAS CHECKING THE LINE BALANCE ON THE LINE SEGMENT WHEN THE COLLEGE STATION FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED TO CONFIRM A RELEASE.  THE COLLEGE STATION FIRE DEPARTMENT ISSUED A PRECAUTIONARY AND VOLUNTARY EVACUATION OF APPROXIMATELY 100 PERSONS FROM THE ADJACENT APARTMENTS TO THE APARTMENT CLUB HOUSE FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES.     AN AUGUST 2008 SURVEY FOR THE APARTMENT DEVELOPER CONFIRMED THE LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE AND EXPLORER PIPELINE API RP1109 PIPELINE MARKERS EVERY 109 TO 175 FEET WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES OF COVER OVER THE PIPELINE. HOWEVER, LESS THAN 6 INCHES OF COVER WAS DISCOVERED OVER THE PIPELINE DURING THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.      NO VALID ONE CALL TICKET WAS IN PLACE BY THE EXCAVATOR THAT CAUSED THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE.  AN EXPLORER PIPELINE EMPLOYEE WAS ON LOCATION THE MORNING OF JANUARY 9, 2009 FOR A STRUCTURAL CROSSING FOR A STORM SEWER APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET UPSTREAM OF THE INCIDENT LOCATION. THE EXPLORER PIPELINE EMPLOYEE WAS NOT ADVISED OR CONSULTED CONCERNING THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT RESULTED IN THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE.     THE SECTION OF THE PIPELINE INVOLVED WITH THE THIRD-PARTY MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS REMOVED, PRESERVED AND WAS TRANSPORTED UNDER A CHAIN OF CUSTODY.  THE REMOVED SECTION OF PIPE IS BEING STORED IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AT DNV.

THE BUCKEYE CONTROL CENTER WAS CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY AND THE PIPELINES IN THAT AREA WERE SHUTDOWN.    AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WAS DISCOVERED THAT BUCKEYE'S 203 PIPELINE HAD A SLIGHT CRACK AT THE PIPE SEAM.  A TEMPORARY SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED AND THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE AT A REDUCED PRESSURE ON MARCH 13, 2009.  THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH CERTIFIED REPLACEMENT PIPE.  THE PIPELINE SECTION HAS BEEN RE-HYDROTESTED AND THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE SENT OUT FOR ANALYSIS.    ALL APPROPRIATE OUTSIDE AGENCIES WERE CONTACTED DURING THIS INCIDENT AND CLEAN UP OPERATIONS ARE STILL PROCEEDING.    REMEDIATION AND CLEANUP HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. BUCKEYE IS WAITING FOR FINAL APPROVAL FROM MICHIGAN DEQ BEFORE CLOSING THIS INCIDENT.

THOSE WELLS ARE IN PLACE TO REMEDIATE A MARCH 18, 2008 RELEASE FROM AN 8"" PIPELINE THAT ALSO RUNS FROM THE REFINERY TO THE HOCKING VALLEY DOCK.

ON TUESDAY APRIL 14, 2009 SUNOCO CONDUCTED AN IN-SERVICE TEST ON THE 6"" PIPELINE THAT CONFIRMED A LEAK IN THAT LINE.  RECORDS INDICATE THAT 114 BARRELS OF MATERIAL WAS RELEASED DURING THE TEST.

BASED ON ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA, SUNOCO BELIEVES THAT BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 218 AND 320 BARRELS OF OIL LEAKED AND WAS RECOVERED.    --------------  AUGUST 5, 2009    IN RESPONSE TO THE RELEASE, THE PIPELINE WAS IDLED AND THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE WAS REPLACED.  A FORENSIC INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED ON THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE BY KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES, INC.  THE FAILURE WAS FOUND TO BE LOCATED AT A CIRCUMFERENTIALLY ORIENTED CRACK ADJACENT TO A GIRTH WELD JOINING A LENGTH OF LINE PIPE TO A TRIMMED ELBOW FITTING.  THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY FATIGUE RESULTING FROM THERMAL EXPANSION AS THE PIPELINE WAS CYCLED BETWEEN NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURE AND AMBIENT GROUND TEMPERATURE DURING IDLE PERIODS.  THE PIPELINE WAS DE-INVENTORIED AND PURGED WITH NITROGEN.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO PLANS TO RETURN THE PIPELINE TO SERVICE.    **UPDATE MADE BY PHMSA ON 4/18/2014 PER DAVID ELLIS ON 3/25/14**  *THE INITIAL REPORT WAS AMENDED TO SHOW A CAUSE CODE UNDER H2, WHICH POINTS TO TEMPERATURE BEING AT FAULT.

THE VALVE WAS NOT PROPERLY ISOLATED FROM A LINE TO THE FACILITY TRANSMIX TANK.  A CHANGE FROM 74 TO 61 GRADE CAME THROUGH THE FACILITY.  THE CONTROL CENTER DIRECTED THE CHANGE THOUGH THE WEST SIDE OF THE MANIFOLD ONLY.  THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THE CHANGE CAME THROUGH THE FACILITY, THE CONTROLLER BEGAN USING THE EAST OIL SIDE OF THE MANIFOLD WHICH CAUSED THE SYSTEM TO AUTOMATICALLY WASH THE MANIFOLD TO THE TRANSMIX TANK.  THIS CAUSED PRODUCT TO FLOW BACK ON THE SEGMENT THE TECHNICIANS HAD OPEN VIA THE TRANSMIX LINE AND ALLOWED PRODUCT TO ESCAPE.  THE CONTROL CENTER RECEIVED A CALL FROM  THE ADJACENT SHIPPER STATING HE SAW PRODUCT SPRAYING.  THE CONTROLLER CONTACTED THE FACILITY. WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD THE WASH WAS COMPLETED AND FLOW DOWN THAT SEGMENT STOPPED.  LOCAL OPERATIONS MADE THE NECESSARY CALLS AND ASSESSMENT AND CLEANUP ENSUED. APPROXIMATELY 67 BARRELS WERE TICKETED DOWN THE LINE.  TECHNICIANS DETERMINED 40 BARRELS WENT TO THE SUMP VIA TWO OPEN DRAIN LINES THAT WERE USED TO DRAIN THE SEGMENT THEY WERE WORKING ON, APPROXIMATELY 10 BARRELS WERE RELEASED AND APPROXIMATELY 17 BARRELS REMAINING IN THE LINE.    ASSESSMENT AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES DETERMINED THAT THE RELEASED PRODUCT SPREAD WITHIN AN AREA MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 50 X 50 FEET WITHIN THE MANIFOLD.  ACCESS TO THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPACTED AREA WAS LIMITED BY ABOVEGROUND PIPING AND CATWALKS. ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES DETERMINED THAT THE RELEASED PRODUCT PENETRATED UP TO 5 FEET DEEP WITHIN THE SANDY SOILS OF THE MANIFOLD AND THAT NO GROUNDWATER OR SURFACE WATER WAS IMPACTED.  ALL ACCESSIBLE IMPACTED SOIL WAS REMOVED AND DISPOSED OF AT AN APPROVED LANDFILL.  A LARGE PORTION OF THE CONTAMINATED SOILS COULD NOT BE EXCAVATED DUE TO THE OVERHEAD PIPING AND CONCRETE PIERS WITHIN THE IMPACTED AREA.  ALTERNATIVE REMEDIAL METHODS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH SCDHEC FOR THE REMAINING IMPACTED SOILS.  THE STATE DHEC OFFICE WAS CONTACTED ON FRIDAY AT 8:20.    A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE (DEE DETWILER) VISITED THE FACILITY AND MET WITH THE DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER.  MR. DETWILER APPROVED OF COLONIALS RESPONSE EFFORTS. APPROXIMATELY TEN GALLONS OF FREE PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED. AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 330 TONS OF SOIL WAS IMPACTED BY THE RELEASE. APPROXIMATELY 97 TONS OF IMPACTED SOIL WAS REMOVED AND DISPOSED OF AT AN APPROVED LANDFILL. PRODUCT IN SOIL CALCULATIONS BASED ON ANALYITICAL RESULTS FOR DIESEL RANGE ORGANICS (DRO) IN THE IMPACTED SOIL DETERMINED A VOLUME OF 442 GALLONS IN THE IMPACTED SOIL. THE VOLUME RECOVERED IN THE EXCAVATED SOIL WAS CALCULATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 130 GALLONS."

THE PIPELINE WAS PREVIOUSLY OUT OF SERVICE AND WITHOUT SCHEDULED PRODUCT MOVEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A RELOCATION PROJECT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION. AT 1800 ON APRIL 24, 2009, GREEN SPRINGS PERSONNEL RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SARNIA CONTROL CENTER REPORTING A LEAK ON THE EASTERN DELIVERY SYSTEM (EDS) AT MP 86.5.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, FIELD PERSONNEL, AT THE ANDERSON ROAD CROSSING TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF A SQUEEGEE PIG AT THE PROPANE /NITROGEN INTERFACE, WERE APPROACHED BY A HOME OWNER WHO REPORTED THE SMELL OF PROPANE IN THE VICINITY. FIELD PERSONNEL AND THE HOME OWNER IDENTIFIED A VAPOR CLOUD CONTAINED IN AN OPEN FIELD ON THE WEST SIDE OF ANDERSON ROAD. FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE VAPOR CLOUD TO BE VAPORIZED LIQUID PROPANE.  FIELD PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED GREEN SPRINGS OF THE LEAK AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES WERE COMMENCED.  RESPONSE ACTIVITIES INCLUDED THE EVACUATION OF LOCAL RESIDENTS IN THE VICINITY OF THE LEAK LOCATION.  SIGNS OF THE VISIBLE RELEASE STOPPED ON APRIL 26, 2009 AS THE GROUND IN THE VICINITY OF THE LEAK FROZE OVER MINIMIZING THE FURTHER ESCAPE OF PRODUCT.  STOPPLES AND BLOCK VALVES WERE INSTALLED BOTH UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM TO COMPLETELY ISOLATE THE LEAK POINT ON THE PIPELINE.  COMPANY PERSONNEL REMAINED ON SITE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE TIME OF DISCOVERY UNTIL 1800 ON MAY 3, 2009 WHEN THE AREA WAS DEEMED SAFE AND NO THREAT TO PEOPLE OR ENVIRONMENT REMAINED.  EXCAVATION OF THE LEAK SITE TOOK PLACE ON MAY 12, 2009 AND A 0.25"" DIAMETER HOLE WAS OBSERVED ON THE TOPSIDE OF THE PIPE.  THE PIPE SEGMENT WAS REMOVED FOR DETAILED METALLURGICAL EVALUATION.  METALLURGICAL EVALUATION RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE PIPE PERFORATION WAS A HIGH VOLTAGE ARC DISCHARGING ENERGY FROM THE PIPE WALL TO GROUND AND IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS LIGHTNING STRIKE."

THE FACILITY IS LOCATED IN UPPER CHESTER TOWNSHIP, DELAWARE COUNTY, PA ALONG STATE HIGHWAY 322.  ON MAY 8, 2009 AT 2334 HOURS, THE PUMP STATION WENT INTO AN AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN/LOCKOUT FROM A HYDROCARBON-LEL DETECTION DEVICE.  LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 2356 HOURS AS A RESULT OF RECEIVING CALLS FROM PASSING MOTORISTS TO 911 REPORTING GASOLINE ODORS AND GASOLINE SPRAYING.  ROUTE 322 WAS SHUTDOWN BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. SPLP RESPONSE PERSONNEL FIRST ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 0011 HOURS.  AT 0040 HOURS A MANUAL VALVE ISOLATING THE RELEASE FROM THE MAIN LINE WAS CLOSED AFTER THE AREA OF THE VALVE WAS MADE SAFE FOR ENTRY.    SUNOCO PIPELINE L.P. IMMEDIATELY MOBILIZED LOCAL OSROS AND COMPANY EMERGENCY RESPONSE CREWS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO THE AREA.  AN ICS WAS FORMULATED TO MANAGE THE RESPONSE.  TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO PADEP, NRC AND PHMSA.  PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED BY A SYSTEM OF INTERCEPTOR TRENCHES AND UNDERFLOW DAMS ON THE PUMP STATION SITE AND OFF-SITE ON HARVEYS RUN BY A SERIES OF CONTAINMENT AND ABSORBENT BOOMS.  GASOLINE FLOWED DOWN HARVEYS RUN FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF MILE.  APPROXIMATELY 285 SMALL MINNOWS, CRAYFISH AND SNAILS WERE FOUND DEAD ALONG WITH ONE WATER SNAKE AND ONE FROG.    THE RELEASE WAS THE RESULT OF A RED-DYE ANALYZER PROBE BEING EJECTED FROM ITS ASSEMBLY MOUNTED ON THE PIPELINE MANIFOLD FOR THE 14-INCH TWIN OAKS TO NEWARK MANIFOLD PORTION OF TWIN OAKS PUMP STATION. SPLP REMOVED ALL ANALYZERS OF THIS DESIGN FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM. THE FAILED ANALYZER ASSEMBLY AND TWO IDENTICAL ANALYZER ASSEMBLIES FROM TWIN OAKS WERE SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT FORENSIC ENGINEERING LAB TO PERFORM BOTH PHYSICAL TESTS AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE THE DEVICES AND TO DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE TRANSMITTER PROBE BEING EJECTED FROM THE PIPELINE.  THIS REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE FAILURE OF THE PROBE COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DESIGN OF THE PROBE ASSEMBLY.  DESIGN DID NOT CONSIDER THAT BOTH THE LOCKING BOLT AND PACKING GLAND ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE PRESSURE RATINGS AT THE LEVEL REQUIRED FOR THE SPLP INSTALLATION.  THE TESTING PERFORMED INDICATED THAT THE LOCKING BOLT ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RESTRAIN THE PROBE AT THE OPERATING PRESSURES EVEN THOUGH THE MANUFACTURER MARKETED THE DEVICES AS SUCH.  THIS INCIDENT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY AL SCHOEN OF PHMSA AND SUNOCO LOGISTICS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT AND REGIONAL MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL."

DURING THIS INSPECTION, A RELEASE WAS DISCOVERED AT THE BACK PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE ON THE INCOMING METER SKID FROM THE NEW QUINTANA /LAMBERT 8 LINE. THE LINE WAS NOT RUNNING AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY AND OPERATOR ON SITE CALLED REMOTE OPERATIONS AND MADE NOTIFICATION NOT TO ALLOW THE LINE TO RE-START.  HE THEN MADE COMPANY NOTIFICATIONS TO START THE RESPONSE PROCESS.  LINE WAS KEPT DOWN WHILE REPAIR PROCESS WAS COMPLETED             USING PI, A REVIEW OF DATA ON THE LINE DURING THE PREVIOUS 24 HOUR PERIOD, INDICATED A CHANGE IN FLOW AND PRESSURE OCCURRED AT 17:30 ON 6-2-09.  PRESSURE WAS 76.4 PSI AT NEW QUINTANA DISCHARGE AND 55.0 PSI AT LAMBERT DISCHARGE AND THE FLOW RATE ON THE LINE WAS BALANCED AT 429 BARRELS PER HOUR AT INJECTION AND RECEIPT METERS AT 17:30. THE FLOW RATE STARTED DECREASING AND THE PRESSURE STARTED INCREASING AND THIS APPEARS TO BE THE INDICATOR OF WHEN THE ISSUE DEVELOPED WITH THE CONTROL VALVE AT THE RECEIPT METER. PRESSURE CONTINUED TO INCREASE ON THE LINE SEGMENT TO IT HIGHEST LEVEL OF 158.9 PSI AT NEW QUINTANA DISCHARGE AND 159.4 PSI AT LAMBERT DISCHARGE AND THE FLOW RATE ON THE LINE WAS BALANCED AT 170 BARRELS PER HOUR AT INJECTION AND RECEIPT METERS AT 00:46 ON 6-3-09. AT 00:48 THE NEW QUINTANA PUMP QUIT INJECTING INTO THE LINE, WHICH IS NORMAL OPERATION WHEN THE THIRD PARTY TANK REACHES LOW LEVEL, A RUN LEVEL SWITCH SHUTS OFF THE PUMP. THE PUMP WILL ALSO START REMOTELY WHEN THE TANK LEVEL REACHES A CERTAIN LEVEL. THIRD PARTY TANK LEVELS ARE NOT SHOWN ON SCADA SYSTEM.  AT 01:15 THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE REACHED 0 PSI, WHICH MATCHES PREVIOUS PERIODS OF DOWN TIME ON THE LINE SEGMENT, AND REMAINED AT THIS LEVEL UNTIL DISCOVERY BY PERSON ON SITE.    ON POST REVIEW OF THE DATA, THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN 17:30 ON 6-2-09 AND 01:15 ON 6-3-09 SHOWS A CHANGE WITH THE PROBABILITY THE RELEASE OCCURRED SOMETIME DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. ONCE THE LINE REACHED 0 PSI THE EVENT STOPPED AND REMAINED STATIC UNTIL DISCOVERY THE NEXT MORNING.    LEAK DETECTION MODEL ON THIS LINE SEGMENT IS A VOLUME BALANCE SYSTEM MEASURING BARRELS INTO LINE VERSES BARRELS OUT OF LINE. LINE BALANCE WAS WITHIN THRESHOLD ALARM LIMITS."

THE REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR A PIPELINE LEAK THAT OCCURRED IN 1989.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5 BARRELS WAS RELEASED.  THE NRC AND MN STATE DUTY OFFICER WERE NOTIFIED.  MNOPS PERSONNEL VISITED THE SITE FOR INSPECTION.    ALL THE WELDS ON THE SPLIT + SLEEVE WERE INSPECTED VIA MAGNETIC PARTICLE EXAMINATION AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OTHER BOLT SEAL WELD WHICH HAD A SMALL CRACK (NOT LEAKING), ALL WERE FOUND TO BE GOOD.  TO REPAIR THE LEAKING PLUG WELDS, A  2-INCH, 3000 LB SOCKET WELD END CAP WAS INSTALLED (WELDED) OVER EACH OF THE BOLT SEAL WELDS.  THE REPAIRS WERE THEN EXAMINED TWICE PER PROCEDURE (ONCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REPAIR, AND AGAIN 12 HOURS LATER) USING MAGNETIC PARTICLE. BOTH REPAIR WELDS WERE ACCEPTABLE.    ONCE THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED, THE CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS REMOVED FROM THE AREA AND BACKFILLED WITH CLEAN IMPORTED SOIL."

MECHANICAL DAMAGE OBSERVED AT THE FAILURE POINT NEAR THE PIPELINE CROSSING INCLUDED MULTIPLE SMALL, VERY SHALLOW SURFACE GOUGES IN A CONCENTRATED AREA AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION, ALONG WITH SOME DEFORMATION OF THE PIPELINE IN THE SAME AREA.  THE PRESENCE OF THE SMALL SURFACE GOUGES AND DEFORMATION CAUSED A LONGITUDINAL CRACK TO DEVELOP AND GROW THROUGH METAL FATIGUE WHEN EXPOSED TO NORMAL OPERATIONAL PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LINE, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO FAILURE.    THE GOUGES AND DEFORMATION FORMED AND WERE LIKELY AGGRAVATED AS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLE STORMS (I.E., HURRICANES RITA, GUSTAV, IKE, ETC)  THE SIGNIFICANT FORCE AND ENERGY OF THESE STORMS SCOURED THE SEABED, WASHED OUT THE ORIGINAL PIPELINE SEPARATION AT THE CROSSING, AND DAMAGED THE CONCRETE COATING.

EXPLORER PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT MP 398.76 AT 12:44 AND CONFIRMED DEAD VEGETATION AND SURFACE INDICATIONS OF A POTENTIAL RELEASE.   UPON EXCAVATION OF THE PIPELINE A LEAK WAS CONFIRMED.  THE LEAK WAS TEMPORARILY REPAIRED WITH A PLIDCO REPAIR SLEEVE UNTIL A PERMANENT REPAIR WAS COMPLETED.         NO FREE-PHASE PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED OR RECOVERED AND THE LEAK VOLUME OF 100 BARRELS IS A CALCULATED ESTIMATE BASED ON INITIAL SOIL SAMPLING AND SOIL VAPOR EXTRACTION.         ALL THE PUMP STATIONS DOWNSTREAM OF GREENVILLE, INCLUDING THE DURANT, OKLAHOMA PUMP STATION WHICH IS THE FIRST UPSTREAM PUMP STATION TO THE RELEASE, HAD BEEN DOWN SINCE 08:32.  THE ONLY PRESSURE SOURCE ON THE PIPELINE WAS A PD PUMP THAT BEGAN INJECTING TRANSMIX AT 10:28 OUT OF GREENVILLE INTO THE 28 INCH SYSTEM.      THE EXACT LEAK DURATION IS NOT KNOWN. THE HIGHEST PRESSURE RECORDED THE LAST 30 DAYS OUT OF THE DURANT, OKLAHOMA PUMP STATION WAS 682.50 PSIG.           THE THROUGH WALL CRACK INITIATED ON THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE PIPE IN A BOTTOM SIDE ROCK DENT WITH MINOR EXTERNAL CORROSION.   THE ROCK DENT IS PRESUMED FROM ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION. THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CRACKING IN ASSOCIATION WITH EXTERNAL CORROSION IS CONSISTENT WITH NEAR NEUTRAL PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKING.        THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY THAT HAS OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT HAS YET TO PROVIDE CLOSURE OF THE REMEDIATION PROJECT. HOWEVER, PHMSA HAS REQUESTED A CLOSURE REPORT.  THEREFORE, EXPLORER PIPELINE WILL ESTIMATE A WORST CASE OF AN ADDITIONAL $962,000 FOR CLOSURE OF THE REMEDIATION PROJECT WITH THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY."

MISSISSIPPI RIGHT-OF-WAY PERSONNEL PICKED UP THE AERIAL OBSERVATION REPORT ON THE MORNING OF 09-30-09 AROUND 07:30 CENTRAL AND IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED LOCAL PERSONNEL TO PAULDING STATION FOR INVESTIGATION OF THE REPORTED SHEEN. INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RELEASE OF PRODUCT. THE FACILITY RETENTION POND HAD A SMALL SHEEN AND THE RELIEF TANK DIKE CONTAINED FREE STANDING PRODUCT THAT WAS BELIEVED, AND LATER CONFIRMED, TO BE FROM A OVERFLOW OF TANK 5056. THE CONTROL CENTER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AND EQUIPMENT IN OPERATION AT THE FACILITY WAS SHUTDOWN. THE AREA OPERATION MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AT 09:22 CENTRAL. THE AREA OPERATIONS MANAGER INFORMED THE DISTRICT PROJECT LEADER, AREA PROJECT MANAGER AND THE DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER OF THE EVENT AROUND 09:30 CENTRAL FOLLOWED BY NOTIFICATIONS TO THE AREA EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR, LOCAL COLONIAL RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND AREA GENERAL CONTRACTOR. AREA SAFETY PARAMETERS WERE ESTABLISHED BY THE EMPLOYEE REPORTING THE EVENT AND WAITED OUTSIDE OF THE FACILITY FOR RESPONSE AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL TO ARRIVE ON SITE. THE GULF COAST DISTRICT LEADER WAS NOTIFIED AT 09:56 CENTRAL. AT 10:08 CENTRAL A FOLLOW UP NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE CONTROL CENTER BY THE AREA OPERATIONS MANAGER TO CONFIRM FACILITY OPERATION STATUS. NO REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WERE MET FOR MISSISSIPPI; HOWEVER, AT 10:10 A COURTESY CALL WAS MADE TO THE MISSISSIPPI DEQ BY THE DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER. CLEAN-UP OF THE PRODUCT CONTAINED IN THE TANK DIKE AND APPROXIMATELY 2-GALLONS ON THE FACILITY RETENTION WERE COMPLETED ON 10-1-09. THE NRC WAS NOT INITIALLY NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT BECAUSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF 49 CFR 195.52 WERE NOT MET OR CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT OTHER THAN THE SMALL SHEEN ON THE FACILITY POND WAS CONTAINED IN THE FACILITY TANK DIKE AND QUICKLY CLEANED UP. ON 10-20-09 AN NRC REPORT WAS FILED WHEN IT WAS FORECAST THAT THE COST OF DAMAGES WOULD EXCEED $50,000.

DURING A ROUTINE CHECK OF THE STINGWATER SYSTEM, THE OPERATOR OBSERVED FREE PRODUCT (GASOLINE) INSIDE THE CONCRETE WALL SURROUNDING THE STINGWATER OIL WATER SEPERATORS AND A SMALL AMOUNT ON THE ADJACENT SPILLWAY. INCIDENT WAS REPORTED AT 0730 TO THE OPERATIONS MANAGER. CLEANUP BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND CONTINUED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 28TH.  A LIGHT SHEEN WAS FOUND ON A PORTION OF POND 2.  NO NOTIFICATIONS TO THE STATE OR NRC WERE MADE SINCE THE POND IS NOT CONSIDERED ""WATERS OF THE STATE"". GROUNDWATER WAS NOT IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE AND NO PRODUCT OR SHEEN WAS OBSERVED AT THE OUTFALL OF POND 2.  APPROXIMATELY 45 GALLONS WERE RECOVERED USING A PNEUMATIC PUMP INSIDE THE CONCRETE BERM. DIAPERS IN THE AREA COLLECTED ANOTHER 4 GALLONS.  A VERY LIGHT SHEEN WAS OBSERVED ON AN APPROXIMATELY 15' X 80' AREA OF THE POND. HARD BOOM WAS USED TO CONTAIN THE SHEEN AND CONSOLIDATE IT TO THE AREA OF THE SPILLWAY.  ADDITIONAL BOOM WAS DEPLOYED AT THE END OF THE SPILLWAY WHERE APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS WERE RECOVERED USING DIAPERS.  APPROXIMATELY 40 TONS OF SOIL WERE EXCAVATED ON THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CONCRETE WALL SURROUNDING THE OIL WATER SEPERATORS.  A MINOR AMOUNT OF IMPACTED SOIL BELOW THE FOOTING OF THE CONCRETE WALL COULD NOT BE REMOVED AND IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN PRESENT PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.  THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WITHIN THE EXCAVATED SOIL WAS ESTIMATED AT 5 GALLONS BASED UPON LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE SOIL AND VOLUME OF PRODUCT IN SOIL CALCULATIONS.  THE EXCAVATED SOIL WILL BE APPLIED TO THE LANDFARM.  EVAPORATION CALCULATIONS CONSIDERED THE AREA OF POOLED PRODUCT WITHIN THE CONCRETE BERM SURROUNDING THE OIL WATER SEPERATORS AND THE POOLED PRODUCT AT THE END OF THE SPILLWAY.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT LOST TO EVAPORATION IS ESTIMATED AT 14 GALLONS BASED UPON EVAPORATION CALCULATIONS FOR THE POOLED AREAS OF PRODUCT. THE TOTAL SPILL VOLUME IS ESTIMATED AT 88 GALLONS OR 2.1 BBLS WITH 69 GALLONS OF FREE PRODUCT RECOVERED USING PUMPS AND ABSORBENTS, 5 GALLONS RECOVERED WITH THE EXCAVATION OF IMPACTED SOIL, AND 14 GALLONS LOST TO EVAPORATION.  AN ESTIMATED 74 GALLONS WERE RECOVERED WITH PUMPS, ABSORBENTS AND THE EXCAVATION OF IMPACTED SOIL."

FOLLOWING THE SUBMITTAL OF THE INITIAL REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VOLUME OF SOIL IMPACTED WAS GREATER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED AND THAT THE ORIGINAL PLAN TO MITIGATE THE SITE BY LAND FARMING  COULD NOT BE PRERFORMED EXPEDIENTLY OR ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE OF STATE PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER COST FACTORS.  THE INCREASED VOLUME OF IMPACTED SOIL WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE AND DEPOSITED AT A PERMITTED DISPOSAL SITE.  THE REMOVED SOIL WAS REPLACED BY CLEAN FILL.

THE FORGED A105 FLANGE EXHIBITED LOW YIELD STRENGTH, VERY LOW TOUGHNESS, AND MARGINAL DUCTILITY.    SEVERAL FACTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BRITTLE CLEAVAGE FRACTURE INCLUDING POOR MATERIAL TOUGHNESS, THE PRESENCE OF A STRESS CONCENTRATOR, AND LOW TEMPERATURE.  THE FAILED FLANGE EXHIBITED VERY POOR TOUGHNESS AND THE FRACTURE WAS OBSERVED TO INITIATE AT A GEOMETRIC STRESS CONCENTRATOR WHERE THE  FLANGE BODY TRANSITIONED TO THE WELD NECK.  WHILE CRACK INITIATION MAY NOT HAVE OCCURRED AT LOW TEMPERATURE, THE ESCAPING PRODUCT WOULD AUTO-REFRIGERATE AND PRODUCE VERY LOW TEMPERATURES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO CRACK PROPAGATION.    THE LOADING RESPONSIBLE FOR FRACTURE INITIATION IS UNCLEAR.  THE FRACTURE  OCCURRED AT THE 6 OCLOCK POSITION ADJACENT TO A 45 DEGREE UPWARD BEND IN THE PIPELINE.  HIGH BENDING STRESSES WOULD BE ANTICIPATED AT THIS LOCATION IN THE EVENT OF PIPE SETTLING, SOIL MOVEMENT, LONGITUDINAL PIPE MOVEMENT (SUCH AS BY THERMAL EXPANSION), ETC.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT PIPELAY OR BACKFILL OPERATIONS AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION SUBJECTED THE FLANGE TO HIGH BENDING STRESS.  REGARDLESS OF THE DETAILS, THE FLANGE FAILURE IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE COMBINATION OF BENDING STRESS AND POOR MATERIAL PROPERTIES."

THE SHERIFF SAID HE HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS OF HYDROCARBON ODOR FROM CITIZENS DRIVING BY NUSTARS FARNAM PUMP STATION.  AT 2355 11/15/09, NUSTAR CONTROL CENTER SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE THE LEADS INTO THE FARNAM PUMP STATION.  AT 2400 11/15/09, NUSTAR OPERATOR ARRIVED ON-SITE AND NOTICED PRODUCT SPILLAGE ON THE PROPERTY GROUNDS.  UPON DETERMINATION THAT IT WAS SAFE TO ENTER THE STATION IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS COMING FROM ONE OF THE TWO PUMPS ON-SITE.  THE SEAL FAILED ON ONE OF THE PUMPS WHICH WERE EQUIPPED WITH A SEAL LEAK ALARM WHICH DID NOT ACTIVATE.  THE PUMP IS ALSO DESIGNED WITH TUBING FROM THE SEAL LEAK DETECTOR DIRECTLY INTO THE ON-SITE SUMP WHICH IS EQUIPPED WITH A HIGH LEVEL ALARM.  PRODUCT IN THE SUMP NEVER REACHED THE HIGH LEVEL MARK.  THIS PUMP IS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A VIBRATION SENSOR ALARM THAT WHEN ACTIVATED WILL SHUT DOWN THE STATION.  THIS SENSOR DID NOT ALARM.    AT 0210 ON 11/16/09, HAZMAT RESPONSE, NUSTAR EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR, ARRIVED ON-SITE TO BEGIN PRODUCT RECOVERY AND SOIL REMOVAL ACTIVITIES.  HAZMAT RESPONSE RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY 35 BARRELS OF PRODUCT AND AN ESTIMATED 36 BARRELS WERE ABSORBED INTO THE SOILS.  OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS THE SOILS WERE EXCAVATED AND PROPERLY HAULED AND DISPOSED AT A STATE LANDFILL.  CONFIRMATION CLEANUP SOIL ANALYSES WERE TAKEN (RESULTS ARE NOT IN YET) TO VERIFY CLEAN CLOSURE THROUGH NDEQ.  ANALYSES WILL ALSO BE USED TO FURTHER DEFINE THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCT RELEASED THAT SATURATED THE SOILS.    ON 11/19-20/09, NUSTAR PERSONNEL INVESTIGATED THE PUMP SEAL LEAK ON-SITE GATHERING PERTINENT DATA.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE ON-SITE INVESTIGATION, THE PUMP WAS CAREFULLY REMOVED TO AN OFF-SITE LOCATION FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.      A REVIEW OF THE BEARING TEMPERATURE DATA GRAPHS GENERATED FROM AN ON-SITE DATA RECORDER INDICATES A RADICAL STEP CHANGE DROP OF TEMPERATURE AT 1800 ON 11/13/09 WHICH MAY BE A SIGN OF THE INITIAL SEAL FAILURE.  THIS COULD BE USED AS THE INITIAL LEAK TIME AND DATE.  WHILE THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL ON-GOING, THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PUMP HAS SHOWN:     SEAL LOCK COLLAR SHOVED ALL THE WAY OUT. SET SCREWS WERE SET AS THE INDENTATIONS ARE ON THE SHAFT AND THEY ARE GROUND OFF ON THE ENDS WHEN THE SLEEVE SPUN. THE CARBON IS GROUND DOWN FLUSH WITH THE RETAINER AND THE TUNGSTEN IS CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES.   THE SEAL LEAK ORIFICE WAS CLEAR.   THERE ARE SOME METAL SHAVINGS UNDER THE BARREL WHERE THE 4TH STAGE USE TO BE.     THERE ARE 3 BRONZE IMPELLERS AND 1 SS IMPELLER IN THIS PUMP. THE 3 BRONZE IMPELLERS ARE ALL CRACKED INSIDE THE VANE AREAS.   ALL THE CASE RINGS SHOW RUBS 180 DEG.

NO ONE-CALL WAS PLACED BY THE MTA CONTRACTOR PRIOR TO THE WORK STARTING.   A CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS LEADING UP TO THIS EVENT IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE CONTRACTOR WAS CONTRACTED BY MTA TO PERFORM A GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY CONSISTING OF THE DRILLING OF A NUMBER OF WELLS AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS. DURING THIS PROCESS, THE CONTRACTOR PLACED SEVERAL ONE-CALLS FOR OTHER LOCATIONS BESIDES SKILLMAN AVENUE.  AS A RESULT OF THESE ONE-CALLS,  BUCKEYE PERSONNEL MET WITH THE CONTRACTOR ON OCTOBER 20 AND 21, 2009 WHERE BUCKEYE PERSONNEL EXPLAINED THAT ANY EXCAVATION WITHIN TEN FEET OF A BUCKEYE PIPELINE MUST BE COORDINATED WITH BUCKEYE.  ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2009 THE CONTRACTOR CALLED BUCKEYES LOCAL JFK STATION TO REQUEST A MARK-OUT OF LINE 601 AT SKILLMAN AVENUE.  THIS LOCATION WAS NOT COVERED BY THE ORIGINAL ONE-CALLS REQUESTED BY THE CONTRACTOR IN OCTOBER.  A BUCKEYE EMPLOYEE PROCEEDED TO LOCATE THE PIPELINE AND MONITORED THE DRILLING THAT TOOK PLACE ON THAT DATE. THE BUCKEYE EMPLOYEE ALSO NOTIFIED THE CONTRACTOR TO CALL BUCKEYE IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE DOING ANY MORE WORK IN THE AREA.  ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009 THE CONTRACTOR RETURNED TO THE SKILLMAN AVENUE LOCATION  AND CONTINUED DRILLING. BUCKEYE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THIS ACTIVITY AND THEREFORE HAD NO ONE ON SITE.  THE CONTRACTOR CONTINUED DRILLING ACTIVITY ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2009 USING A LARGER BORE HEAD THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY USED. AGAIN, BUCKEYE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THIS ACTIVITY AND HAD NO ONE ON SITE. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:55 A.M., THE CONTRACTOR STRUCK THE PIPELINE CAUSING THE RELEASE. BUCKEYE JFK STATION PERSONNEL WITNESSED THE PRESSURE LOSS AND LATER RECEIVED A  PHONE CALL FROM THE CONTRACTOR NOTIFYING THEM OF THE LINE STRIKE.  BUCKEYES MAINTENANCE CREW WAS DEPLOYED AND PERFORMED EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS WHICH INCLUDED THE REPLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 4 OF DAMAGED PIPE.  BUCKEYE NOTIFIED ALL APPROPRIATE OUTSIDE AGENCIES OF THIS INCIDENT.  UPON BUCKEYES REVIEW OF THIS INCIDENT, IT HAS DETERMINED THAT ITS PROCEDURE FOR PROPERLY LOCATING THIS PIPELINE WAS NOT FOLLOWED.  BUCKEYE IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT.    ALL REMEDIAION AND CLEANUP HAS BEEN COMPLETED. BUCKEYE'S INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THAT PROCEDURES WERE NOT FOLLOWED. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO REINFORCE BUCKEYE'S COMMITMENT TO SAFETY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING PROCEDURES."

THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION BY KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES OF THE FLANGED CONNECTION SHOWED THAT THE GASKET LACKED ADEQUATE COMPRESSION OR CLAMPING FORCE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT BOLT LOAD OR TORQUE.  DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE STOPPLE AND SANDWICH VALVE GASKET SEALING SURFACES WERE WITHIN TOLERANCES OF ASME B16.5 FOR THE FLANGE SIZE AND CLASS.

STRESS ENGINEERING REPORT SUGGESTS THAT FRACTURED SURFACES ON THE SCREWS CONFIRMED THAT THE FRACTURES HAD OCCURRED BY WAY OF HYDROGEN ASSISTED CRACKING.   THE HIGH HARDNESS OF THE ATTACHMENT SCREWS PROBABLY PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE CRACKING PROCESS.  ZINC RICH DEPOSITS FOUND ON SCREW #1 APPARENTLY DID NOT PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS CORROSION OF THE SCREW.  THE PRESENCE OF SOLUTIONS CONTAINING ZINC SALTS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED CRACKING OF THE SCREWS INDIRECTLY BY PROMOTING GALVANIC COUPLING BETWEEN THE SCREWS AND THE MORE CORROSION RESISTANT STAINLESS STEEL HOUSING.

BUCKEYES 8 PIPELINE IN THE AREA (CT553JP) HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN EARLIER IN THE DAY AS PART OF A NORMAL, SCHEDULED SHUT DOWN AND THE PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS BEING MONITORED. AFTER NOTIFICATION FROM BUCKEYES CONTROL CENTER, FIELD PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF GASOLINE ODORS.     AT 12:45 A.M. ON DECEMBER 30, 2009, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (PADEP) MEASURED GAS ODORS IN SEVERAL ADJACENT SANITARY SEWER MANHOLES  AS WELL AS A FEW NEARBY RESIDENCES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED THE EVACUATION OF FOUR RESIDENCES AS A PRECAUTION UNTIL THE VAPOR LEVELS SUBSIDED.  AT 1:40 A.M. ON DECEMBER 30, 2009 A UNIFIED COMMAND WAS ESTABLISHED BY BUCKEYES LOCAL OPERATIONS MANAGER. BUCKEYE PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO WALK THE PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY AND ALTHOUGH NO VISIBLE PRODUCT WAS SEEN, THEY DID DETECT AN ODOR IN SOME AREAS.  BUCKEYE DECIDED TO WALK THE PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY AGAIN DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS AND TO DIG TEST HOLES IN THE AREAS OF HIGH VAPOR LEVELS. BY NOON ON DECEMBER 30, 2009, BUCKEYE HAD A TOTAL OF TEN LOCATIONS PROBED BETWEEN CHERRY TREE STREET AND OVERLOOK STREET WITH NO PRODUCT FOUND. THE TEST HOLES DUG ON ARBOR LANE WERE ALSO FOUND TO BE CLEAN OF PRODUCT.     AT 12:28 P.M. ON DECEMBER 30, 2009, THE PADEP REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE VICINITY OF SCOTT LANE BECAUSE THE SEWER MANHOLES ON CHERRY TREE STREET AND FRAZER STREET HAD HIGH VAPOR LEVELS. BUCKEYE DECIDED TO EXCAVATE THE GASOLINE TANK LINES INSIDE THE ADJACENT CHELSEA STATION SINCE THESE PIPELINES WERE CLOSER TO SCOTT STREET. AT 10:00 P.M. ON DECEMBER 30, 2009 BUCKEYE PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED HIGH VAPOR LEVELS AND VISIBLE PRODUCT IN THE EXCAVATION AT THE TANK JUNCTION VALVES IN CHELSEA STATION. THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO BE ON THE TANK 701 LINE. AT 1:30 A.M. ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, BUCKEYE INSTALLED A PLIDCO SLEEVE, WHICH STOPPED THE RELEASE.  AT NOON ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, ALL RESIDENTS WERE CLEARED TO SAFELY RETURN TO THEIR HOMES.  ON JANUARY 1, 2010, THE LOCAL SEWER AUTHORITY CONFIRMED AT LEAST THREE BREACHES IN THE SANITARY SEWER LINE LOCATED UNDER CHERRY TREE STREET.  THESE BREACHES ALLOWED GASOLINE FROM THE RELEASE TO GET INTO THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.  THE LOCAL SEWER AUTHORITY IS PRESENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REPAIRING THE SEWER SYSTEM IN THIS AREA.    BUCKEYE CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE PLIDCO SLEEVE TWICE DAILY UNTIL PERMANENT REPAIRS CAN BE COMPLETED, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 8, 2010.  BUCKEYE HAS DUG NUMEROUS TEST WELLS AND CONTINUES TO WORK ON BOTH THE REMEDIATION OF THE RELEASE AND DETERMINING THE ESTIMATED VOLUME. BUCKEYE NOTIFIED ALL APPROPRIATE OUTSIDE AGENCIES OF THIS INCIDENT.     PERMANENT REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED ON FEBRUARY 12, 2010 BY CUTTING OUT THE DAMAGED PIPE AND REPLACING IT WITH CERTIFIED PIPE. THE DAMAGED PIPE HAS BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.     METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REVEALED THE CAUSE OF THE EXTERNAL CORROSION TO BE MICROBIOLOGICALLY INDUCED CORROSION. REMEDIATION IS STILL ON-GOING. OPERATION OF THE FACILITY WAS TURNED OVER TO CONOCOPHILLIPS ON 3-1-11.      ----------------  UPDATE 12/11/12  COSTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT ACUTAL AMOUNTS AFTER TURNING OPERATION OVER TO THE OWNER, CONOCO PHILLIPS. THIS RELEASE REPORT IS BEING FINALIZED BY BUCKEYE. NO FURTHER UPDATES WILL BE SUBMITTED."

ALL FUEL WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE COMPOUND AREA AND DID NOT MIGRATE OFF THE PROPERTY. BP AND PIPELINE PERSONNEL CONTAINED THE FUEL SPILL WITHIN THE BP TANK FARM. WE PROCEEDED TO RECOVER THE FUEL SPILL WITH THE HELP OF VACUUM TANKS FROM BP AND TOTAL. THE AMOUNT OF FUEL SPILL OUTSIDE THE SUMP TANK WAS 35.21 BARRELS AND THE AMOUNT RECOVERED WAS 32.21 BARRELS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE RECOVERED A 100% OF THE SPILL. BY 14:30 THE SAME DAY THE PRODUCT SPILL WAS COMPLETELY COLLECTED AND IT WAS GIVEN THE CLEARANCE TO PROCEED WITH NORMAL PUMPING RECEIVING OPERATIONS. FORTUNATLEY THERE WERE NO PHYSICAL DAMAGES OF CONTAMINATION OF ANY AFFLUENT STORM SEWER COLLECTOR AS THE PRODUCT SPILL NEVER CAME CLOSE TO ANY ONE OF THEM.

DURING THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, DECEMBER 1, THE GENEVA OPERATOR BEGAN TO PREPARE AT 11:15 A.M. FOR PIPELINE/TANK ACTIVITIES SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT AROUND 12:15 P.M. DURING THIS TIME HE RECEIVED AN EXPECTED HIGH LEVEL ALARM ALERTING HIM TO SWITCH 16"" PIPELINE RECEIPTS FROM TANK 30-2 (HIGH LEVEL ALARM) TO TANK 30-4. PRIOR TO OPENING THE 30-4 VALVE, THE OPERATOR FAILED TO CLOSE THE ASSOCIATED BLOCK AND BLEED VALVE THEREBY ALLOWING PRODUCT TO ESCAPE THE VALVE BODY. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE PRODUCT FLOWING THROUGH THE BLOCK AND BLEED VALVE WOULD ESCAPE TO THE GROUND NEAR THE OPERATOR'S FEET, HOWEVER, DUE TO CONSTRUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANIFOLD AREA, THE VALVE HAD BEEN CONNECTED TO A PIPE WHICH CARRIED THE PRODUCT SOME DISTANCE AWAY AND EMPTIED INTO A RELATIVELY SMALL CONTAINER (AROUND 25-30 GALLONS) AND WAS INITIALLY UNNOTICED. THE INCIDENT RESULTED IN A ONE BARREL SPILL TO THE GROUND IN THE MANIFOLD AREA. SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL OCCURRED KEEPING THE PRODUCT ON TOP OF THE WATER WHICH WAS PUMPED INTO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR AND ALL PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED. NO SOIL IMPACT.</P>"
