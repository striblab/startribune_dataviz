I have been a fitness walker for years, walking four miles a day at least every other day. On days I can't walk four miles I walk two miles in walking shoes and have had no problem.<br>In June, the inside of my left knee started to ache and I chalked it up to getting older. I am 54 so thought this was middle aged aches and pains. Last Monday while I work I felt sharp jolts of pain and went to the Urgent Care doctor where I was diagnosed with an inflamed ligament, which I am to ice, wear a knee sleeve and take two Advil capsules twice a day. The next morning, my husband read the article in the August, 2011 Consumer Reports about these shoes and it clicked. I have had no other changes in my routine except buying these shoes.<br>I didn't like the feel of them that much, but for $134 I thought I would wear them until my 500 miles were up to buy a new pair. Now I wish I would have stopped wearing these earlier.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Plymouth<br><b>Product</b>: Aetrex<br><b>Status</b>: Injury, Seen by Medical Professional</div><h3 class="acc-name two">Aldi, Inc.</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(8/8/2014) My few months old programmable coffee maker somehow became defective and defaulted to the ON position with the heating element being on.

My HS624 leaked fuel all over my garage floor and it could have been very dangerous situation for me and my family. I also saw from that same report (20120206-98E63-2147470528) that Honda had a recall for HS724 snowblowers for the same problem. If these are the same parts used in that HS724 why isn't the ones in the HS624 replaced?

Based on this amount of time in service without maintenance to the fuel system, Honda strongly recommends that the owner have their snow blower inspected by a Honda dealer as soon as possible. The fuel system, including the rubber fuel delivery hoses and fuel filter should be routinely inspected for deterioration according to the maintenance schedule in the owner's manual. Because the fuel filter performed without problem for as many years, it is highly unlikely that the leak is the result of a defect or has any relation to the recall that affects other models manufactured more recently.</div><h3 class="acc-name two">American Lighting, Inc.</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(2/24/2012) The fluorescent bulb was flickering.

The machine died while I was driving at a very slow pace of about 15 - 20 MPH. As I attempted to diagnose what the issue was smoke begin to emerge from under the seat by the battery casing.

(Two 3 packs) They are a small flat plastic panel that glows when plugged into an outlet. I bought them to replace similar night lights, so I plugged them into the same outlets I had used for a many years. After having the new ones plugged in for a couple weeks, I started to notice a burning smell in my kitchen on various occasions. However, I couldn't locate the source. Several days later I saw an outlet smoldering and quickly unplugged the light. The back of the Nite Lite was burnt and blackened where it plugs into the wall. Subsequent checking of the other lights turned up one other light that was partially melted but less severely, on a separate circuit in a different part of my home.

We chose this waterheater because the vent and hook up were an exact fit for the 20 year old [REDACTED] tankless water heater originally installed in our home. The Bosch water heater is designed such that the heat exchanger is placed near the vent of the water heater. As such, it has flash frozen four times since it was installed (freezes very quickly). The latest episode caused the tankless water heater to rupture the heat exchanger in two places, dumping water all over our basement floor. During this time, the heater continued to operate continuously producing considerable noise, heat and steam. Luckily for us, we were home at the time and heard the commotion in our basement. Otherwise, the heater would have continued to pour water on the floor and run continuously.<br><br>I called Bosch before this incident to inquire about a backdraft preventer. They do not offer such a product for this water heater and do not seem very concerned about the potential for problems. The service people suggested that we contact an HVAC person to see if they could balance the house. As I mentioned, we had the previous tankless water heater for years without incident. It would occasionally blow out the pilot light from down drafts. But, the downdrafts were not a persistent problem and likely resulted from a rapid change in barometric pressure that causes an imbalance between the outside and inside air. We were convinced that an HVAC person would not be able to offer much in the way of solutions, particularly since the problem was so rare and episodic.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Duluth<br><b>Product</b>: The product in question is a tankless water heater designed to provide hot water to a household.

The home came with a 48 gallon, natural gas, Bradford White water heater that provides the hot water for the in-floor radiant heat. Model Number M2TW50T6BN1<br>Serial Number CE7691231<br>The water heater vent (chimney), a 4" Schedule 40 PVC, has turned brown. This suggests to me that too much heat is being passed to this vent. The vent pipe is brown for about 5' from point where vent attaches to the top of the heater. The total length of the venting pipe to the outside of house is about 15'. There is only one 90 degree elbow in the vent passageway.<br><br>I called Technician [REDACTED] at 1 800 538-2020 at Bradfor White. He said he did not know what the operating temperature should be where vent attaches to top of heater. He assured me that it was less that what the 4" Schedule 40 PVC was rated for. He first said is was rated for up to 170 degrees farenheit, then changed his mind and said it was rated for up to 160 degrees farenheit.<br><br>My local installer measured the operating heat at this point at 178 degrees farenheit. Said that he has removed "many" of these heater over the past two years. Does not install them anymore. Believes there is a problem with the baffles but could not be specific. No carbon dioxide.<br><br>I am now, 9/16/2011, in the process of replacing this unit only 5 years old because I believe it to be a potential fire hazard.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Sauk Rapids<br><b>Product</b>: 48 Gallon, Bradfor White, Natural Gas.

We encourage all Breville product owners to contact our support center if they ever have a concern or question regarding a Breville product they own (safety or otherwise). In this case we did work with the consumer to retrieve the oven and it has been inspected to determine the root cause. It appears the power cord sustained damage at some point and this was the cause of the issue the consumer reported. The following two tips will support a successful user experience when operating the oven. Leave 4 inches of clear space around the oven when in use. Prior to powering on the oven, double check the area around the oven to ensure no power cords or other materials can come into contat with the unit while in use.

I was traveling on asphalt at about 15-20mph. There was no apparent reason for the lock up - I sustained injuries to my elbow and knee. It could have been much worseI have pictures of my injuries and the bike. I went on line to see if there were similar reported incidents with the bike model. I found that the model had been recalled for a chain breakage issue. The bike is a Bridgeway Model LBH2611M Serial LWJIO1972 and when I called the company the verified that it was manufactured January 12, 2011 and was part of the recall. I bought the bike from Walmart in Bemidji MN - in the Spring of 2012. I have had chains slip off the sprockets on various bikes before but nothing like the lock up that happened with this bike. I am a healthy 54 year old male in good shape. My fear is for others who this may happen to. I contacted Bridgeway and they took my information down and offered to send me a derailer and chain but at this point I am not sure I want to ride this bike again. I have the bike available for inspection.

(Bombardier Recreational Products)</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(7/28/2012) I recently purchased a Can Am (made by BRP) 2012, Ountlander 1000XT four wheeler. The cost of the machine was around $13,000 US dollars.Right after the purchase, I discovered over on one of the social network sites there was a post in regards to micro-cracks taking place on the new first year "Gen2" frames. At first, BRP completely denied this, referring only to the internet as being a great place for people to start rumors. Later on, they did admit to a handful of cracked frames and professes that the owners had abused them. When I took my machine in for its' 10 hour maintenance check, I asked my dealer to check it for the cracked frame. They knew nothing about the claim. I showed them the site I had been visiting, which includes numerous detailed pictures of the issue. They later stated they had spoken to BRP and checked my frame. They stated that I currently did not have the cracks. Now - it seems that BRP has come out with a brace, that is applied to the frame for extra stability. It also seems that the rapidly approaching 2013 models, same frame, will have these braces installed at the factory as a standard part of the frame. What about us folks that have the 2012 frames - with potential cracking issues. It seems that they can crack at any moment, under any circumstances ??? Please see this for complete details http://www.can-amforum.com/forums/can-am-2012-models/35563-2012-can-am-outlander-renegade-gen2-frame-cracking-pictures-posted.html<br><br><br><b>Location</b>: Clear Lake<br><b>Product</b>: Four wheeler with potentially dangerous cracking frames<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(8/21/2012) BRP US Inc. (Bombardier Recreational Products): BRP released a communication (bulletin number 2013-1 G2 Platform - Chassis Reinforcement Kit) to our dealer network on August 15, 2012 for all 2012 Outlander and Renegade ATVs, and selected 2013 ATVs with a G2 frame. The bulletin states that a crack along the front upper frame section could develop if the vehicles listed in the bulletin are operated in an intensive environment or manner. The owner of a vehicle listed in the bulletin can choose to have a Chassis Reinforcement Kit (" Kit ") to halt crack propagation along the front upper frame section. Also, if a customer wants proactive installation of the Kit (no crack yet on the frame), BRP will support the repair. Installation of the Kit is discretionary. At any point in the life of the vehicles listed in the bulletin, BRP will install the Kit at no cost to the owner. The Kit should take about an hour to install and is a simple process. In addition, BRP will cover chassis functional failure in the front upper frame section as shown in the bulletin for a period of 7 years (standard warranty for this part is 6 months) from the vehicle registration date, with or without the installation of the Kit. This coverage is effective on all vehicles listed in the bulletin. This warranty is transferable and clearly stated in the bulletin. As part of our continuous product improvement process, a running change has been implemented during Model Year 2013 production. However, there has been no functional failure resulting from this frame section cracking, neither in tests or in racing, nor on customer vehicles. For the customers who have done a repair while waiting for BRP to release this solution, BRP will look at those on a case-by-case basis. For those who had the frame welded per BRP instructions, BRP will provide assistance. The quickest and easiest way to begin that process is by filling out the following form: http://www.brp.com/en-us/customer-service<br></div><h3 class="acc-name twelve">BSH HOME APPLIANCES CORPORATION</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(1/2/2013) Control boards continue to short out causing a risk for a fire.

The new holder does absolutely nothing to fix the described problem. My coffee maker spilled ground coffee and hot water before and does so after I installed the new part. I feel like this fix is just a pacifier for consumers but not a fix to a bad product. I still believe that the machine is dangerous and that I could get burned from it. I always stay 2 feet away from it when I am making coffee. I called Bosch and informed them about the problem but they don't seem to care and don't want to take care of my issue.

Both my daughter and I got headaches from the smell that emanated from the brewer and it only got worse with each passing day. That unit was returned to Amazon with the explanation that the smell was obnoxious. A new brewer was received as a replacement with the same problem. I called the Bunn customer service line and complained about the smell and was told that it was from the glue used in China and it would go away with frequent use in three or four weeks. We tried to run the brewer about twenty times and the next morning the smell was worse than ever. I have had a headache for two days, daughter cannot stand the smell in the house and my wife came down with a sore throat to the point she lost her voice.

There a warning label in fine print which reads, "people who are photo sensitive and have had seizures due to flashing lights should consult a doctor before using this toy. There is possibility that photo sensitivity may occur in children who has no history of seizure or epilepsy". This warning is very difficult to read. The child was taken to the Mayo Emergency hospital in MN by ambulance where she was treated and sent home for further follow up and testing. 12/26/13 She contacted the manufacturer through email and requested them to contact her by phone. She is concerned that this toy has caused her child who has never had a seizure to become vulnerable and she has to be constantly watching her child.

On this model when you back up you have to pull up the pto control switch to prevent the mower blades shutting off. Because the blades shut off with any pressure on the reverse pedal the tendency is to pull up the pto switch while still moving forward. My grandson apparently did this but because of the proximity of the cruise control switch which is immediately adjacent he accidentally engaged the cruise control. He was approaching a 6 foot drop off and in an attempt to stop he stepped on the reverse pedal, the forward and reverse of the equipment is controlled by pedals. However the cruise control cannot be disengaged this way and he went over the 6 foot wall sustaining a concussion and various injuries. Luckily he is doing fine with no ongoing problems. While I realize that the machine was operated in a manner not consistent with the manual I have concerns with the design because I believe the manner in which the machine is likely to be used this senario could repeat. I feel it was poor design to place the cruise control and the pto switch adjacent such that it is relatively easy to pull up both simultaneously. I also think a natural reaction to stop forward motion is to hit reverse and am concerned that this does not disengage the cruise control. I have reported this incident to John Deere and they have stated they will look into the issues but thought it best I also report here.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Belle Plaine<br><b>Product</b>: lawn tractor with mounted mower<br><b>Status</b>: Injury, Emergency Department Treatment Received<br></div><h3 class="acc-name two">Delta Enterprise Corp</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(12/21/2013) I purchased a Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib by Delta this october for my newborn, after putting the<br><br><b>Location</b>: anoka<br><b>Product</b>: Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib by Delta<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(8/10/2012) The Delta Tyson 3-in-1 crib I have used for two children has an ongoing problem with the space between the slats.

My wife was reaching for something in the cabinet above the range, and she accidently pushed in the knob and turned it to that position. She did that without knowing what happened. There is nothing mechanically wrong with the stove or the ignitors, this, apparently is how Frigidaire makes gas stoves. The first time this happened, we noticed a strange smell in our house. It did not smell like the normal gas smell. At the time, we had a cat and I thought that is was a urine smell from her.

The child appears to have been scratched by one of the Velcro tabs which fastens a portion of the soft seat to the jumper itself and covers the metal support frame of the jumper. This child had been safely using the product for approximately a month before this incident occurred. The Velcro tabs are sewn in a location which will not contact the child when properly closed. Over time and use by a child jumping in the unit, it is possible that the Velcro became unfastened. To help ensure continued safe use of the product, Evenflo states in the product instructions: "Before each use, MAKE SURE frame tubes, straps, and seat are securely fastened." This product hangs in a doorway and enables the child to jump in the unit, so checking the secure connections of the frame to the doorframe and the seat pad to the frame before each use is critical for safe use.

My wife bought a stainless steel thermos bottle which according to the labeling is made in China and distributed by Fleet & Farm stores. The cap has a valve which looks like one should be able to sip from it, but if you try the liquid doesn't come out where you expect it to, but lower down, just like a "dribble glass" only much faster. The first time my wife tried to drink hot tea from the thermos she scalded her chest and had huge blisters. We have pictures and she had to see a dermatologist. We complained to Fleet & Farm and asked them to remove them from sale. A representative asked for a copy of our receipt and other info, but 9 months later, they are still selling the bottles and have never responded to our complaint. I have complained twice in the past few weeks to two assistant store managers and they say they have no authority to take anything off the shelf.

A few days later, I switched the FitBit over to my left wrist and wore it there until February 20th. That morning I woke up with a terrible rash/burn on my left wrist, and a smaller one on my right wrist. The rash appeared right underneath where the FitBit Force has its charging port. I stopped using the Force immediately. By Tuesday February 25th my rash/burn had grown across my wrist and become much worse. I went into urgent care, and was given a steroid cream to help clear it up. As of today, March 3, the rash/burn is just beginning to heal, but has a long way to go. It is still very painful and itchy. I am concerned about what caused this issue, especially because it seems to be systemic. I had not worn the FitBit on my right wrist for over 2 weeks, and the rash/burn still appeared on that wrist, the same day it did on my right wrist. I am also concerned about the compromise on the immune system this has created. If my body was fighting hard to respond to the rash/burn, could of it made me vulnerable to other infections. Three days after the rash broke out, I came down with a terrible sinus infection and eye infection. Neither of which am I prone to getting. I have since heard others reporting similar issues on FitBit's Forum. The FitBit company has not offered any information yet on what is the definite cause of the reaction.

The exception is the tit and feel of the adjustment knobs on the front of the range. The knobs do not feel solid; they wiggle and wobble as they are being adjusted, primarily due to the long plastic shaft that weakly connects the knob to the valve shaft.I showed the situation to a GE repair technician making a repair call for our refrigerator and he showed me that a cracked plastic shaft (see photo 1) caused the problem. Every burner knob had the same defect. The lower oven knob was OK, probably due to the shorter plastic shaft and/or stronger material used for that knob. Due to the high cost of replacement knobs (the service technician thought replacement knobs would have the same design), I decided to just Jive with the wobbly knobs. However, I recently returned to a smoke-filled home caused by a burner being left on under a pot of food. My wife had turned the burner knob to the off position before leaving home but the knob had slipped on the valve shaft and the burner remained on. In the daylight, the flame was not visible under the large pot Upon inspection of the knob, I found that the cracked plastic shaft had allowed the metal insert to fall out, thus making the knob Jess connected to the valve shaft (see photo 2). I verified that the burner could remain on with active flame even with the knob in the off position. It made my wife feel better that she hadn't forgotten to tum off the burner, but it pointed out to me a issue with this knob design that should be brought to your attention. In the interim, I have decided to repair the plastic shaft with epoxy. If replacement knobs are available of a higher quality, I would strongly consider purchasing them. At minimum, I would appreciate receiving one or two of the metal inserts that have been lost so I can more effectively repair the knobs.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Woodbury<br><b>Product</b>: GE Cafe Series Dual Fuel Convection Range<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(4/20/2013) my GE microwave made a grinding sound and flames began shooting out from under the turntable. the flames went out when I opened the door.

I searched for the source off and on during that time a decided that it may have been from and abundance of cardboard boxes in my basement or new drywall I had installed in my basement (this was at the time of the Chinese drywall recall) and figured it would eventually go away. One day when my allergies were acting up and my nose was more sensitive than usual I went looking for the source again and found a loose gas fitting in my kitchen stove. I tightened the fitting and have not noticed the smell since. The fitting was not in the supply line but rather inside the stove at the block that the supply line fed into. I only had to turn the fitting on the tube about 1/4 turn to stop the leak.

The wind was not aggressive but enough to pick up the umbrella and the stake. It flew up in the air 15 feet, and then quickly carried it 20 feet behind me. I dove out of the way and fortunately there were not people behind me. The stand is a heavy metal pole with a metal foot piece and a sharp metal, spear like point at the end.This is the 3rd occurrence. On a separate occasion, June 2012, I was sitting on the ground with my easel painting. My mom was standing next to me with her Shade Buddy. The wind changed directions, picking up her embrella with stake. She grabbed the umbrella handle to prevent it from flying away. With the top half secure, the bottom end (below the hinge) swung around very quickly and hit me. I contacted the company. They have not replied.

We have determined that [REDACTED] was using the Shadebuddy improperly and under extreme conditions. [REDACTED] states that she contacted our company but received no response. On August 14, 2012 our company did receive a communication from [REDACTED] concering our Shadebuddy Umbrella and the incident contained in her report. Our company made immediate and repeated attempts to respond to her. Unfortunately [REDACTED] provided a non-existant email address, so we were unable to establish contact with her. We made several efforts to locate her through our dealers and other resources. When we received the report from CPSC which contained accurate contact information for [REDACTED], we contacted her by telephone. In the ensuing conversation we were able to determine that [REDACTED] had been using the Shadebuddy Umbrella inappropriately. She was using it in windy conditions that our labeling and instructions specifically warn about and that she had not released the safety latch designed to keep the ground stake from being pulled out of the ground in the even of a heavy wind gust. Further, in her report, [REDACTED] stated that Guerrilla Painter is the retailer from which she purchased her Shadebuddy Umbrella. Guerrilla Painter is not a retailer. In our discussion with [REDACTED] , she stated that she could not remember where she bought the umbrella.</div><h3 class="acc-name two">Habermaass Corp.

The warming plate stays hot whether or not you use the carafe side. This is a problem when the right side single-cup brewer doesn't work. It sounds like it's heating up but the water stays in the unit. When I try to empty the unit, sometimes the water comes out and sometimes it doesn't. Today, suddenly, the water came out 5 or 10 minutes after I removed a mug. While trying to stop the flood, I inadvertently burned my skin with the hot water and the plate, which was still hot after the single cup brewed. I had to take the carafe off the unit in order to drain the water that never came out of the single serve side. Fortunately, I was near a sink and applied cold water and ice immediately so I will be fine. It is a defective and dangerous product and I am requesting a full refund from Hamilton Beach. I purchased this at Sam's Club in Fridley, MN in November, 2013 so it has been less than a year. I paid $79.99 plus tax. I could probably get a receipt from Sam's, and it will like be on my credit card, but I think Hamilton Beach should refund the money regardless of whether I can find the receipt from last November. I have emailed Hamilton Beach with this exact complaint and I told them I would be filing a complaint with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I hope you will investigate this problem and remove this product from the market.

We are very sorry this consumer had a negative experience with one of our products, as we try hard to please consumers who have shown their trust by bringing our products into their homes. We encourage our customers to contact us at 1.800.851.8900 in order to provide information about their experiences. We have not had an opportunity to examine the product to verify the consumer's experience. We understand the consumer to have experienced the following: he starts the brew cycle, water does not pass through the brew basket as quickly as he thinks it should, he removes his mug and allows the coffeemaker to remain on in the brew mode, water then passes through the brew basket but there is no mug to collect it; and in response, he removes the carafe, grabs the bottom of the coffeemaker with both hands and turns it upside-down over the sink in an attempt to empty the water reservoir. Instead of turning off the coffeemaker when he removed his mug, or replacing the mug when the water flowed, he burned his hands catching flowing water and grabbing the carafe side warmer plate. As the coffeemaker automatically shuts-off within five minutes of first pressing the on button, the foregoing must have occurred within five minutes of starting the brew cycle. The Use and Care manual provides instructions on removing water from the reservoir, "Turn brew selector dial to carafe and push BREW NOW button to remove water. Wait for 3 beeps and blue power light to turn off. Restart the Single-Serve process." This dispenses water into the glass carafe.<hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(5/19/2013) Hamilton Beach 6 Slice Capacity Toaster Oven. Model 31507R, Series A1901DV Timer failed, such that timer continues past the "Off" position and continues until it stops at the "Stay On" position. Oven then continues to operate indefinitely. On testing for the problem, the timer consistently failed to stop at "Off", failed to sound the bell, and continued to "Stay On". This failure is not obvious to the operator until the contents of the oven begin to burn. This is a serious fire hazard as well as a burn hazard for anyone who, unaware the oven is still operating, touches the outside of the appliance.

Programmed/used once monthly for early meetings. 12/3/12 - had noticed slight burning smell in break room week before and realized this day that hot plate had come on without ever turning on the machine. Carafe extremely hot, and machine would not turn off without unplugging. Spoke with HB - replacement to be sent under warranty for cost of shipping. 12/20/12 - received replacement. Within 1 month, noticed auto shut-off feature not working - light shuts off, but hot plate remains on and won't shut off without unplugging. After this, kept unplugged, though we bought this product for the timer feature and it would need it to be plugged in to use this. Did not bother returning, as same problem as last time and didn't want to pay shipping yet again. 2/19/13 - Opened cover to place filter. Took out filter basket to clean (did not touch the front of the machine) and the machine immediately got very hot and began steaming (must have had water remaining in the system). Coffee maker was not turned on. I hurried to fill the water and place filter and coffee while steam coming out. Made entire pot of coffee without ever turning on the machine. Emailed HB again, with product info (43254R, A4221D). Seems to be a hazard to have a coffee maker that comes on and gets very hot when not in use.

The toaster did not pop up like it was suppose to and the cancel button didn't even work to stop it when i went running down to see what was going on. I had to unplug the toaster and force the knob up to stop it from toasting. The bread was burnt to a charred black little piece of a fire waiting to happen!! I have 2 children under the age of 3 and a puppy and we were all exposed to the terrible strong black smoke. We live in MN and it is the middle of winter, so it's not like we can just run out of the house or open all the doors and windows and let the house air out for days. It was a very dangerous and scary situation for my family, and left our house smelling of smoke soot for weeks on end. I contacted Hamilton Beach immediately from the information I had on the bottom of the toaster and they said they would replace it once they received our old one. It took them 5 weeks to get a new one mailed out to us. This is a daily appliance we use in our household. So, today, we finally received the new one via UPS. We opened it and plugged it in to test it out...the very first time we pushed the handles down in the toasting position, the right one blew out w/a loud sound and sparks. We tried it a second time, and it did this very same thing again...we immediately unplugged it and will not be using this brand new toaster we were just sent as a replacement.

We paid $249 + tax for this dresser. This evening, when my 3 year old son when getting clothes out of the dresser, an entire drawer came off from the dresser and pinned him down. He was in shock and crying, until we came running to lift the drawer from his mid-section. Luckily, he wasn't injured. The Hemnes dresser is unsafe and not fit for use.

Our children weighed 25-50lbs during its usage and it claims to be rated to 75lbs. The cord simply snaps while the child is jumping causing them to hit the floor instead of bouncing up. Its unlikely that there will be significant harm since the jumper is so close to the ground but there is some risk of injury. We did not get around to trying to replace the cord until right now when our younger kids are coming to the bouncy age. In shopping for a new cord I noticed the reports of the same experience from other owners including the government report. I did contact the manufacturer listed in the incident linked above and they informed me that there were no recalls on the product.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Northfield<br><b>Product</b>: The Pure Fun First Jumper features an easy grip padded handle for extra stability and sturdy<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(9/24/2012) JamzProducts.net: As noted in the company response from the previous incident cited in this complaint, despite our own extensive internal testing, CPSIA and ASTM safety certifications for this item, and our best efforts to ensure a seamless, safe, and fun jumping experience with this trampoline, there are certain circumstances in which a bungee bounce system will fail. This includes improper installation, extensive use, abuse, enviromental issues and other unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, this specific part--the bungee cord--is a consumable, and as such is not guaranteed for the lifetime of the trampoline. We clearly state in the instructions that along with careful adult supervision of children, that the bungee cord system be carefully inspected prior to each use for any signs of damage or fraying and replaced before use if any damage is found. All trampolines with bungee cord bounce systems are susceptible to these terms and conditions of recommended use regardless of manufacturer. I apologize for any inconvenience that this issue has caused, and in light of their frustration with this matter have extended an offer to the customer to receive a complimentary replacement part for this item although their warranty period has long since passed. We will also send along a new copy of the manual which includes safety instructions and also should assist with installation of the bungee system.<br></div><h3 class="acc-name two">Jardine Enterprises</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(9/2/2011) I just learned of the recall on my baby crib.

We purchased our 2000 Manufactured Home brand new in 2003. It had never been lived in. Several weeks ago our furnace started smelling very hot. We could smell something burning each time the furnace went on. I called Minnesota Energy to come and check our furnace. They discovered that the heat exchanger had a big hole burned in it. They checked on the recall of Coleman furnances, but our Model was not on the recall list. They gave me several numbers to call to report this to Coleman. No one cared! We had to have this furnace removed and when the technician pulled out the Coleman furnace they discovered that a large hole had been burned through our sheetrock wall in our home. The furnace had a large break in the metal and was burned throughout that area. The repairman said we shouuld report this because this is EXACTLY what the recalled furnances had happen in all the other circumstances. We had to have a new furnace installed by Dales Heating in Pine City and they said they would be willing to confirm what I have just reported. We feel Coleman should reimburse us for this faulty furnace and they should add this Model number to their recall list. Please try to help us in this matter.

I did not actually use the stove at that time. Last week, I got out my stove to fry fish and when I began to pressurize the fuel tank with the pump, I noticed a significant gas leak from the shut off valve on the pump. The leaking fuel was sufficient to create a decent sized puddle where I was setting up the stove. When I took the valve apart there were just remnants of an O-ring in the valve. I tried replacing the O-ring with one from a hardware store, but it did not work and the leak continued. The stove is completely unsafe to operate with this gas leak.

During the first change there was no sign of irritation. When I went to change there the 2nd time I noticed an extremely bad rash that was starting to blister. I was extremely nervous so I rushed her up to urgent care. I was inrmed by the dr that she has a chemical burn. The diapers that we just started using were the Huggies Snug and Dry and have used only a few out of the pack. We have never used these in the past and she does not have previous diaper rash irritations. She also does not have sensitive skin. The dr prescribed us 2 oitments to place on the affected area and informed me to stop using these diapers immediately. My daughter is in horrible pain and you can not even change her without her screaming from using a wipe or warm wash cloth. We have gone out and purchased the [REDACTED] oatmeal bath and the dr said that should help as well. The dr informed us to leave her diaper off as much as possible to let it get some air.

Shortly after delivery I noticed a strong smell of gas from the unit, only present while running. I ran all service lines to the appliance with a gas detection monitor and discovered no leaks. While observing the operation of the unit to ascertain the root cause of issue it was quickly determined that the gas control valve was opening after the heating sequence was complete and without the presence of a heat source. As a result the dryer was venting NG through the system and outside the house. This continues to be an ongoing issue. To which I cannot seem to get resolution. The units were new when purchased, under warranty, under extended service agreement and due to the information below no one would even look at the unit. NOTE: Due to issues with retailer at the time of purchase, delivery delays, and a concurrent multi-year extended third-party service contract this unit has not been reviewed by any service personnel. That is another monster of a fiasco to which this medium is not an appropriate venue. The short version is relevant however: two-month delay in delivery of unit led to retailer refusing to return unit because it too much time passed since the original purchase date, at purchase retailer improperly recorded service contract information into system which then failed to completely register the third-party service contract (contract shown with third-party provider, but not associated with any devices - third-party was never able to resolve issue; contract has expired), according to retailer LG refused to authorize retailer (Home Depot) to service unit due to presence of third-party agreement even while under manufacturer warranty, LG support contacted via email with no response, LG support contacted via telephone with declaration that there was no defect in unit.<br><br><b>Location</b>: St Louis Park<br><b>Product</b>: 27<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(10/19/2012) LG Electronics, USA: LG manufactures this dryer to meet or exceed all relevant standards including ANSI Z21.5.1a.

She could not get the blister pack out of the sleeve so she pulled it with her teeth which resulted in her cap coming completely out/off. She is reporting the packaging that requires the consumer to push the designated button and pull the prescribed medicine container out of the sleeve as an unsafe product. She is reporting this as unsafe due to the difficulty of following the instructions and accessing the medicine because this would lead to actions other than the directed one's such as use of teeth. She went to her dentist on January 20th, 2014 and was advised that they cannot replace the cap, she has to have an implant instead. She has what is called a "flipper" to hold the place and appear to have a tooth in that place. The flipper is not paid for by the insurance company and will pay for only a portion of the implant. She contacted the manufacturer January 20th, 2013 via email, received a return call from them on January 21st, 2014.

The glass globes are extremely thin, and while gently grasping one in my hand, it broke into shards of thin glass. Fortunately, I was not injured.

It was not by a heater or turned on. My husband could smell the burning. Our house burnt down in January due to furnace issues. My now 8 month old son received this as a gift, after the fire. I could not imagine what may have happened. This is a very unsafe product and needs to be recalled. I wasn't able to get in contact with anybody despite trying several different numbers.

The outer shell of the fluorescent lamp in the ceiling fan-light fixture blew up and not only it blew up itself, but it exploded the light fixture on the fan. The light fixture on the fan is a standard glass shell, shaped like an open-ended cone, and the light bulb can be installed right through the opening, without needing to remove the fixture. The explosion sent thousands of tiny pieces around, along with about a dozen medium size pieces, and a few large size pieces. The largest projectile was about 5'x2' with ragged edges. The force of the explosion was such that projectiles went as far as 5 yards, hitting the wall in the hallway, and reflecting in the opposite direction, so one could see the glass in the hallway, before you even turned the corner into the room. The glass was all over the couch, carpet, bookstacks, and my husband and I spent two hours cleaning it up late into the night. Explosion was so powerful that when we lifted the couch pillows, there was glass underneath. When we moved the couch to clean under it, we found the pieces of glass on the wall behind it. It was the matter of big luck that no one was injured. At the time of explosion, I usually read on the couch, and it was an exception that I went to bed early that day. This product needs to be taken off the market immediately, because it presents a danger of laceration and puncture. On Monday, September 10, 2012, I contacted the manufacturer, the Osram Sylvania company. My report was recorded and my information taken. I was told that someone from the company will contact me within 48 hours. Nobody ever called or contacted me in any other way, which makes me suspect that the company is aware of the problems with its light bulbs. At a minimum, the company has no interest to ensure their product safety by properly investigating the report.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Eagan<br><b>Product</b>: Sylvania Fluorescent dimmable flood light<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(10/1/2012) OSRAM SYLVANIA, Inc.: Screw-based compact fluorescent lamps have become a popular alternative to incandescent lamps due to increased efficiency and reduced operating costs. The industry realizes that some customers are concerned regarding the manner in how a small number of compact fluorescent lamps fail. Some customers believe that such failures may present a safety concern at the end of the lamp's life. Even though most compact fluorescent lamps fail in a benign manner, during some failures it is possible that smoking, odor, and/or charring of the base plastic housing could occur. SYLVANIA screw-based compact fluorescent lamps utilize a UL rated plastic housing that is flame resistant and also serves to contain any internally failed components, thereby preventing them from causing an unsafe situation. Although such experiences represent a foreseeable normal failure mode of these lamps, some customers may become alarmed, dissatisfied, or otherwise consider such situation as unacceptable and feel that they must report such failures to safety agencies. It is important to understand that although the aforementioned failures may occur; these lamps have been tested for safety.

Some Compact Fluorescent Lamps may smoke at their end of useful lifetime. CFL lamp housings are flame resistant and will not maintain an flame or fire as they are made from a UL rated UV0 material.<hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(10/7/2011) The fluorescent bulb was placed in an open vanity light for approximately 11 to 12 month total .The light fixture was put in the on position estimating 10-15 minutes when suddenly she smelled smoke and saw smoking coming. While the light bulb was smoking she noticed that the light bulb was still operating. The light fixture was powered in the off position and the bulb was carefully removed (the item used to remove the bulb is unknown) and she noticed that the plastic casing had burned through. The bulb was placed in a guest bathroom that is rarely used. She experienced the same hazard with three other fluorescent bulbs manufactured by the same firm that were also placed in various different fixtures in the home. The bulbs were placed in the home all at the same time and the last three incident occurred a week after the original hazard occurred. She noticed that the casing at the bottom were brown and scorch looking and emitted a burning smell but they did not catch fire. Around the later part of 2010 she returned all the bulbs to the retailer ad received a full refund to purchase another brand of bulbs. The firm and was contacted the month 7/2010 and asked the consumer to mail the light bulb in so that they could evaluate the light bulb. The consumer decided not to mail the light bulb back because she does not believe they take her concerns seriously.

Do not use the pacifier for infants with teeth. Do not use if the baby can place the entire pacifier in his/her mouth. As the baby gets older, the possibility of the pacifier fitting in the mouth increases. Do not leave the baby unattended with a pacifier.

It was a curved slalom-type slide (with no sides).He now has multiple fractures in his tibia and is in a cast for at least 9 weeks. I see that a similar slide has been recalled, but I don't see anything for this one, made by Little Tikes Commercial (PlayPowerLT). http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml12/12109.html If one brand has been recalled, I would think others with the same product should also be recalled.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Mound<br><b>Product</b>: curved slalom slide with no sides.http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml12/12109.html<br><b>Status</b>: Injury, Emergency Department Treatment Received<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(9/28/2012) PlayPower LT Farmington, Inc.: Every product user is important to Little Tikes Commercial, and we take all consumer complaints seriously. The incident described by the parent of the 4-year-old who "fell off of a slide at his school playground" occurred on an N-G-R Builders� play system, which is specifically designed to "make fitness fun by encouraging stretching, upper body strength, unique movements and competitive spirit." This "slide" is a Balance Rider, which is not a slide at all. It functions differently than traditional slides because it requires the product user to balance their body by straddling the rail during descent. For safety purposes, the design of the Balance Rider deliberately gives the product a taller profile that requires more contact with the user's legs, which further secures a straddling position and promotes balance, strength, and control during use. The Balance Rider also has footholds and handholds that provide a 3-point contact for the user during this exercise.\tAs stated on its labeling, the Little Tikes Commercial Balance Rider is intended for children ages 5 to 12 years. It is not designed for children under the age of 5 because younger users lack the physical development and balance needed for exercise on this type of equipment. All Little Tikes Commercial play systems include age-appropriate labeling and warnings to advise users, parents, and playground supervisors. Also, CPSC guidelines state that "[p]arents and playground supervisors should be aware that not all playground equipment is appropriate for all children who may use the playground. Supervisors should look for posted signs indicating the appropriate age of the users and direct children to equipment appropriate for their age." Also, the Balance Rider is a different product than the "similar slide" mentioned in the Report of Harm. As noted here, the Balance Rider has a different design and is not a slide. More importantly, the "other slide" mentioned by the parent was recalled because it "lack[ed] a transition platform on the top and sides and on the chute. Children can fall when moving from the ladder to the slide and when descending the chute." These are requirements for traditional slides and, according to the CPSC press release, was recalled for those reasons.<br></div><h3 class="acc-name four">Polaris Industries Inc.</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(11/15/2011) 2005 polaris fusion 900 fuel tank neck cracked and gas would seep out and pour all over my clothes when i was riding<br><br><b>Location</b>: hugo<br><b>Product</b>: 2005 fusion 900 polaris black and red<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(12/9/2011) Polaris Industries Inc.: Polaris has received two contacts for this machine by two different consumers, one of which was the registered owner. Both of these contacts occurred in November of 2011. Both contacts were inquiries to Polaris whereby the consumers asked if there are any recalls on their machine. No mention was made by either consumer of a fuel leak that occurred in February of 2010. Polaris asks that the current owner of record present his or her machine to a Polaris dealer for evaluation of the alleged fuel tank neck failure. Upon presentation to the dealer, the dealer and Polaris will be able to make an evaluation of the failed part or parts and determine if any further action is warranted. While Polaris cannot determine what may have caused this particular issue, Polaris is aware that failures of this type can be caused by undue stress being placed upon the filler neck area by gasoline fill nozzles. Such a failure would require the consumer to replace his fuel tank as part of normal maintenance. Polaris is also concerned that there are three safety recalls and two service bulletins that are open on this machine (these recalls and bulletins were released in 2005 and 2006). Polaris urges the consumer to promptly present his machine to a Polaris dealer so that these issues can be taken care of irrespective of any outcome concerning the fuel tank neck issue. The consumers that contacted Polaris in November of 2011 were informed of these bulletins, but to date Polaris has no record of these bulletins being completed.<hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(4/10/2011) My 2005 Polaris ATV 500 started on fire and burned in its entirety.

In about 10 minutes it burned items that should have taken close to 30 minutes to bake at that temperature, so it was considerably over the heat selected and indicated on the digital face. Upon smelling the burning we turned off the oven, at which point sparks flew from the control panel. This thing is a fire hazard.

Once they were done, I turned the oven off as usual and went about my business. Later, I came back to the kitchen and the oven was on, element glowing orange. I thought I just forgot to turn it off, so hit the cancel button again. Nothing happened. I ended up having to flip the circuit. A Sears tech came out and found the problem on the circuit board of the oven. It was fixed and had been working fine until yesterday. I checked my baking banana bread and decided it needed a couple of more minutes. When I opened the door a couple of minutes later, smoke came pouring out as the tops were black...this time the upper element was orange and the oven wouldn't turn off. Again, I had to got to the circuit to cut the power, so it would turn off. I feel this is extremely hazardous and needs to be investigated!!!<br><br><b>Location</b>: Eden Prairie<br><b>Product</b>: Kenmore smooth top electric oven cream colored. model 66595024101; serial RP2714284)<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(11/14/2013) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.

Model# S3218ANB My model is the following: Model #: 148.16156210 Serial #: ANB0008703 Previously seared a steak or two using the side burner (it is a sear-type burner). Recently decided to sear a steak and when I lit the sear burner a large amount of flames were venting out of the air gap at the front of the burner. Flames where striking the wiring and instrumentation on the front panel of the sear burner. The controls and wiring were exposed to flames. If left unattended the flames would have started the wiring and controls on fire. The flames occurred regardless of the burner intensity (at the lowest setting the flames continued to be directed toward the instruments and wiring). I shutdown the sear burner after about 2 minutes of operation. I re-lit the sear burner after 1 to 2 minutes and the sear burner was operating as expected. There appeared to be clogging of the burner element from a previous searing of steak. After the incident occurred I have been careful to allow the sear burner to burn off any grease or fat on the sear element and the issue ***appears*** to not occur.

About 15-20 minutes into the cycle I heard an unusual noise coming from the dishwasher. I came into the kitchen and could smell melted plastic and could see smoke (not steam) coming out of my dishwasher. I then opened up the door and when I did a snapping sound occurred and a horrible odor came out with more smoke. This happened again when I opened the door again to show my husband. I then removed all the dishes, unplugged the appliance, and left the door shut. I had a repair person come to check on it who said there was a fire in the front panel and the entire dishwasher would need to be rewired, which is illegal for them to do. She called to the service department to check on a recall, and they told her they had a number of written complaints about the dishwasher but did not see a recall. I then called Sears and after approximately 6 phone calls I was told there was no recall and was informed that all service calls related to any faulty appliance is directly reported from the service company to the Federal Agency in charge of recalls. I then contacted the service company and they told me that Sears had misinformed me: I would have to report the incident myself. My concern is that someone could have a fire, lose their home, or worse yet, their lives, because there is a fault in this dishwasher. If I had gone to bed, been out of the house, or even been in a different part of the house and not heard the noise, who knows what could have happened.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Burnsville<br><b>Product</b>: Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665 . 16939000<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(12/6/2012) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.

This last time my husband was able to get element to turn off after turning knob on and off five or six times. The previous time this happened to me, 3rd time, I spent about five minutes trying to turn knob from on to off positions and vice versa. I even took plastic knob off and tried turning metal post with pliers to no avail.

There was a known controller panel problem at that time which was fixed promptly by Sears. But, about 9 months later after using the oven, I noticed the shelving no longer seemed to fit as snuggly as it should. I basically needed to balance the shelves exactly on the outside ridges to keep the shelves from falling down in the stove. I did order a replacement shelf hoping that would fix the problem, but the new shelf fell through as well. I have now reached the point where I cannot set anything heavy on the shelves in the oven or they will just collapse. This has basically made my oven useless to me.

She searched the home for the location of the smell and was unable to pinpoint exactly where it was coming from. When I came home I immediately received a strong smoke/burning odor when I walked in the door. The smell was strongest in our kitchen. I searched the kitchen and pulled the refrigerator out and saw ash and a burn mark on our kitchen tile. I immediately unplugged the refrigerator. I called the fire department to come over to take a report as it appeared the fire was out. I pulled the back cover off the refrigerator and found more ash, burned wires and burned electronics mounted to the compressor. I used a spray bottle to spray everything down with water. The fire department took information from the refrigerator for their report and left. I am glad that we had a ceramic tile floor because any other type of flooring may have ignited and caused a house fire. I did some research and found that this is a common problem with Whirlpool, Kenmore, and Maytag refrigerators of this vintage. It appears that a recall was issued for the Maytags and possibly the Whirlpools, but not the Kenmore. Sears may want look at recalls on these units, because it very easily could have been a house fire.<br><br><b>Location</b>:<br><b>Product</b>: Kenmore Side-by-Side Refrigerator, White, through the door water/ice<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(12/28/2011) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.

He made an attempt to power the oven in the off position with the control panel and it would not power off which also caused the pizza to burn up. The circuit breaker was then pulled to cease power to the unit. The heating elemnet began to grow bright red when the failure occured and the temperature heated to another temperature that was not selected. On 10/31/2011 after powering the circuit breaker in the on position and placing the oven in the on position at 350 degrees they noticed the heating element was glowing bright red. When making attempts to power the oven in the off position it would not power off and the circuit breaker was pulled again to cease power to the oven. No repairs have been made to the unit and the circuit breaker is still currently pulled to prevent any power to the range. Because consumer has to keep the breaker off she can't use the stove either/ If the breaker is on the oven heats automatically to extreme temps and cannot be turned off.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Bemidji<br><b>Product</b>: electric slide in range<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(12/19/2011) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.

It stayed on at full power, glowing orange the entire time. Changed temperature settings on the control panel it is stayed on. Turned off the oven on the control panel, and it still stayed on. Finally had to shut the breaker off to the oven so it would finally stop heating. Similar behavior probably occurred 2 months ago but we didn't know what happened at the time because the broiler element managed to shut-down on it's own, but the baked goods caught on fire.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Blaine<br><b>Product</b>: Kenmore Self-Cleaning Electric Range<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(12/15/2011) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.

After the usual few minutes, the oven beeped, indicating that it was done preheating so, I put the cupcakes in the oven to bake for the recommended amount of time. I took out the cupcakes once they were golden on the top, pushed "off/cancel". As I was cleaning up the kitchen, I noticed the element was still glowing orange as if it were still on. I figured I had forgotten to turn it off, so I pressed "off/cancel" again. The element continued to stay on even though the panel indicated that the oven was off. While I was trying other buttons to try to get it to turn off, I noticed that the element was not cycling on/off as it usually does. I checked the cupcakes and the bottoms were a very dark brown - a sign that the oven had not been cycling on/off as it usually does, but that the element stayed on the entire baking time. At this point, the oven was starting to smell like things were burning. Since I was unable to quickly reach the outlet to unplug it, I turned off the power supply at the fuse box. After about 30 minutes, I turned the power back on. The oven panel indicated that the oven was off, but after a few minutes, the element was glowing orange again. I ended up turning off the power at the fuse box again and left it off until we had a serviceman take a look at it. He stated that the problem was the control panel circuit board.I feel that this is a huge safety issue and am glad that I hadn't left the kitchen or had chosen "time bake" and left the house!

This melted the plastic around the light unit and scorched the light sockets. The control unit fell due to the melting and was too hot to touch. Food on the top shelf was very warm. This problem (heating and melting) occurred between noon and 6 pm. There was an odor of burnt plastic. We unplugged the refrigerator and called a local repairman who said he knew of this problem with Sears Kenmore Refrigiratores (model 795.773004600). He said that we would have to call Sears and have them fix the problem. We called Sears. They offered to come for a $75 service call and a one year service plan for $250, if we agreed to the plan BEFORE they came out. They would not estimate the cost of the repair without coming out and the service plan was not an option once the service call had been made. We requested to be put in touch with someone who dealt with recalls and complaints. After a half hour run around only to return where I had started, we gave up. We then went to the Consumers Affair web site and found a number of similar complaints from people with refrigerators the style and age (3 years) of ours. We contacted Sears Live Chat on line to see if there had been a recall on this model. We received no satisfaction, only a repeat of the service call information. It is frightening to think of what could have happened had this occurred when we were asleep or out of town. Because of our concern about the possibilty of a fire we chose not to fix our 3 year old Kenmore nad purchased a different brand from a different store.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Elko<br><b>Product</b>: Kenmore Refrigerator model 795.77304600<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(3/30/2011) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.

The lids bend around and snap onto the outer edge lip of the glass container. My 11 year old son was eating fruit and noticed something hard in his mouth and upon removal my wife identified it as a small glass shard, approximate 1 cm in length. He did not cut his mouth. We could not determine where the glass came from but found additional shards of glass in the fruit stored in the Glasslock round storage container. We noticed the outer rim was damaged and clearly had a rough edge where some glass had broken off in several locations. The broken areas were focal in nature and likely related where the lid snaps onto and locks onto the container. We inspected another clean round container and found similar glass defects. We inspected the square containers but did not find any defects. I am reporting this as: 1) I believe it is a design defect related to the lid locking mechanism and the force it applies to a small portion of the thin rim of glass and, 2) my concern that another person may injure themselves by eating a piece of glass. I have saved all the containers we own of this type and will ship them to you for inspection. Please consider a recall of this product before someone sustains an injury. Thank you.

Sony Electronics 6/29/2014 Sony battery pack np-fx110 exploded and separated so it is open Hayfield Sony battery np-fx110 Unspecified (7/11/2014) Sony Electronics: Sony has reviewed this report. From the limited information provided and after internal review, Sony does not believe that the product in question creates an unreasonable risk of injury or contains a defect which could pose a substantial product hazard. Sony engineers have previously identified this service issue and determined that in rare cases a swelling of the internal battery cell pouch can occur which can result in the two halves of the battery pack's plastic enclosure to separate, without a compromise to the cell pack other than the swelling. These analyses have been reviewed by and confirmed by Sony's Director of Corporate Product Safety. A Sony representative will be contacting the customer within the next few days for further investigation. Sony Electronics 8/26/2012 This laptop was purchased in 2009 and began overheating then.

I was very disappointed to find that this recall does not cover their chainsaws which is this SAME cap design. I own a chainsaw made by Stihl and have no less than 5 times been soaked with fuel while using the saw and having the cap come off while in use. I have had my clothing and shoes soaked with not only gasoline/oil mixture, but also chain saw bar oil, which also has a resivoir that uses the same cap design. In my opinion Stihl needs to be pressured to include their saws in this recall, as they are just as much of a safety hazard as the other products included in the recall. Completely aside from the safety issue, they are also an environmental one as well. Chain saw bar oil has spilled from my saw on several occasions onto the soil. I took responsibility and properly cleaned up the spill as not to have my ground water which I drink from my private well contaminated.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Sartell<br><b>Product</b>: Stihl Chain saw with 16<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(1/27/2012) STIHL, INC.: We appreciate you calling this matter to our attention. At STIHL Incorporated, safety is a top priority, and we are sorry to hear that you experienced fuel and oil leakage while operating your STIHL chain saw. Without additional information we cannot determine the exact reason for your problem. However the fact that you were having difficulty with both the oil and fuel filler caps on your chain saw suggests that the caps were not closed properly or could be damaged. With a seven-year-old machine, even normal wear and tear obviously can affect the performance of various components. Per our Instruction and Safety Manuals, (which are available from any authorized STIHL dealer or downloadable at www.stihlusa.com) you should never start or run any STIHL product in the event of fuel leakage. Please stop using your chain saw immediately and take it to your nearest servicing STIHL dealer (www.stihldealer.net/locator), who will be able to correct the problems you identified and inspect your chain saw for any needed repairs or maintenance. Please note that the STIHL products voluntarily recalled by STIHL in cooperation with the CPSC on May 25, 2011 (the "Recall") were recalled because the levels of ethanol, aromatics or other additives in some gasolines at times made fuel caps more difficult to install or remove, and not, as you noted, due to a "faulty gas cap design." For that reason, the Recall did not include oil filler caps, which are not exposed to ethanol or other fuel additives. Again, thank you for calling this matter to our attention. If you have any other questions or concerns about the operation, safety or performance of your STIHL chain saw or any other STIHL products, please contact your local STIHL dealer or us directly at 1-800-GO-STIHL and press "2" for Technical Services.

The unit has been used infrequently, but mostly on cold evenings during the wintertime. Approximately 2 weeks ago, I smelled a plastic burning odor emitting from the top of the heater while it was turned on. I turned off the unit for the evening after inspecting it. The unit visually appeared to be ok. On 03/20/2014, I turned the heater on a high level. After approximately 45 minutes of being in use, I heard a fizzing noise, followed by a little pop with a spark emitting again from the top of the unit through the wire screen that protects the heating element. Almost immediately, smoke started to come out from the unit in the area where the on/off switch is located. I quickly unplugged the heater and removed it from the home as it continued to smoke. After ensuring there was no further risk of fire, I again inspected the unit and took notice that the knob to the on/off switch had melted on the bottom side. I have contacted Holmes to inform them of this product issue. There have been multiple reports on the internet of this same issue occurring with this model heater. Holmes has indicated to me that there currently is no active recall. I feel that the chance for tragedy is extremely high with this unpredicatable unit.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Otsego<br><b>Product</b>: Electric heater, sitting about 1ft high, 2.5 feet wide.<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(4/3/2014) Sunbeam Products, Inc. d/b/a Jarden Consumer Solutions: Jarden Consumer Solutions encourages consumers with any concerns about our products to contact us directly (if they have not already done so) at jardencs.com (http://www.jardencs.com/ContactUs.aspx) where consumers will find brand specific contact information, including toll-free phone numbers.

I was delighted but somewhat curious to find that Target had donated a number of these brand-new, unopened and unused heaters. Now I know why.Good news: The small unit pumps out a lot of heat. Bad news: You better sit next to it and watch it at all times. One of my frisky cats knocked it over, face-down, and it did not shut off. It got hot enough to scorch the vinyl kitchen floor tile and the much-heralded overheating sensor failed to work. Had it been on carpet, etc., this thing could have started a fire that would have burned down the house! Now we know why Target so kindly donated these units to Goodwill instead of destroying them.

I did not use it again that weekend. Monday May 28th we woke to smelling smoke at 7:10 am, the gas grill was on fire, there were flames about 6" high coming off of it. My husband grabbed the garden hose and put it out. Normally we would not have been there but because it was a holiday we just happened to be there. Had it been any normal Monday it would have burnt our place to the ground. I contacted Amana and asked to split the cost of $550.00 for a replacement grill. Amana said it is not their problem. It is my belief that they are the ones who chose to use cheap parts that rust away. The people that I have had look at it have come to the conclusion that it ground out because of rusty parts which caused a spark and started the electric igniter on fire. We still have the grill sitting there waiting for someone to tell us what to do. We have pictures for you to look at if you need. Amana is no longer making grills. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP.

The flame went out when our son dropped the gun in fear, but it was still smoldering for another minute where the flame had occured on the cap paper.

The entire hinge and screws remained attached to the lid, which was no longer attached to the step stool at all.I had never thought of reporting it until I saw the recall today of other, similar step stools.

It is manufactured by Baby Jogger. The model number is BJ90123. It is a newer model of a product from the same manufacturer that was recalled on August 28, 2013 (Model number BJ90121, CPSC recall number 13-272). Though at the time of that recall, it was noted that "Newer models have only four holes and are not being recalled," in my case the newer model has the same flaw & weakness and therefore carries the same risk. The car seat adaptor consists of two U-shaped, black, aluminum support bars and two black plastic adaptors that allow the support bars to attach onto the stroller. The black support bars are labeled A and B. The A support bar is the larger of the two U-shaped bars and has a red plastic tip with 4 holes. One of the red plastic tips cracked and broke, rendering the adaptor useless. This crack & break happened during first-time assembly, within minutes of removing the product's parts from their original packaging. The only pressure applied to the U-shaped bars was the pressure required to assemble the product itself. Specifically, the product cracked & broke when I was trying to connect support bar A and support bar B through the two black plastic adaptors. When pushing the right side in (so that the green button clicks), the red plastic tip on the left side cracked & broke. The U-shaped bar cracked & broke prior to actually using the fully assembled product for its intended purpose. There were no injuries in this instance but the risk certainly existed had it been installed on the stroller.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Minneapolis<br><b>Product</b>: The product is a Car Seat Adaptor for Single Strollers.

Baby Jogger's website indicates that the adapters work with [REDACTED] seats, as does the information enclosed in the packaging of the Car-Seat adapters. I installed the adapters according to the instructions and the car seats seemed to fit - but not securely. I was concerned about the safety of the car seats in the adapters - and tried to research how to make it work. Finally I called Baby Jogger who informed me that their adapters do not work with the [REDACTED] models (only the [REDACTED]). They advised it might not be safe to use them with [REDACTED]. Why does this mater to the CPSC? It sounds like I am more upset that I have to try to return two car seats. That's true - but if you review the Baby Jogger website and enclosed packaging materials - there is no easy to find indication of the incompatibility and potential safety issue. There is a comment in the Baby Jogger FAQ page - but nothing in the product description that tells you about it, or recommends to call or check the FAQ's. I think it's possible that someone being less-attentive to detail could miss this issue - and be exposed to a safety issue with their babies. Baby Jogger - especially in this case where they know there is a compatibility issue - should be compelled to clearly state it on their product information on their website and in the packing materials.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Minneapolis<br><b>Product</b>: Baby Jogger Car Seat Adaptor for City Select<br><b>Status</b>: Unspecified<br><hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(7/28/2013) By the way, this is the 3rd time I am trying to fill out this report. Even though I saved it several times, the saved link does not bring me back to my basically completed report. I wonder how many other reporters just give up because of a bad website. Here we go again: I have a City Mini Single stroller that I've used since September of 2012. On many occasions, I have set the brake and a minute or so later heard a click and the brake has released. I have usually been right next to the stroller so this has been annoying but not dangerous. It often happened when I was trying to put an attachment on, or want to fold the stroller, but sometimes it would do it just when the baby was sitting in the stroller and no one was touching it. I could not tell a difference between the times when I set the brake and it came undone or when I set the brake and it was fine. Today, I had the stroller on a sidewalk with a slight incline (the sidewalk that borders our yard). I set the brake and stepped about 5 ft away to pick some weeds. My back was to the stroller and I heard the familiar click. I turned to see the stroller rolling towards the street and heard my neighbor yell who was also witnessing this. At this point, I really realized was a safety hazard this was. If I hadn't heard the quiet click he would have rolled over the curb into the street.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Rochester<br><b>Product</b>: City Mini Single Baby Stroller<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br></div><h3 class="acc-name two">The Children's Place</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(6/14/2011) Around noon, consumer said that her daughter, 2 years and 9 months old, was in her little pool in the back yards for 30 minutes.

The item number on the tag is RN70530/CA31802. The overalls are made of denim and have a green car on the front pocket and green, blue and yellow cars on the shoulder straps. The straps attach to the bib via large metal snaps. I washed the overalls once before adding them to my son's clothing. When my husband attempted to use them the snap on the left side of the bib separated, with the cover of the snap staying on the bib and the inner pat of the snap remaining attached to the strap. Luckily my husband noticed this right away before my son was able to get the snap cover into his mouth. I am concerned that this defect poses a chocking hazard.

I have two of these lamps, the other of which is in the living room....both have experienced similar issues but the one in the bedroom is the particular one that prompted me to write this complaint. I turned on the lamp this morning and left the bedroom for about 2 minutes and when I returned the light was very dim and there was a clicking sound. The other lamp has occasionally gone dim as well but never with a clicking sound. I looked at the socket where the light bulb was installed and noticed blue sparks therefore I unplugged the lamp. There was a foul electrical odor in the air (which has happened on the other lamp when it was dim before as well). I let the lamp sit for two hours for the bulb to cool down. When I tried unscrewing the bulb from the lamp, the bulb shattered and cut me because the base of the bulb was actually fused to the lamp socket. I reported the incident to Hampton Bay as both lamps exhibited the same issue but the response I received did not seem very concerned which prompted me to write this complaint. I am not sure if it was a bad batch of lamps or if this is a common issue but I believe the product to be very unsafe.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Saint Paul<br><b>Product</b>: Black Hampton Bay Floor Lamp (Model #398-505) with White Plastic Top<br><b>Status</b>: Injury, First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional<br>(8/9/2013) The Home Depot: Home Depot takes product safety issues very seriously.

First of all we are aware the trays can start to deform at a temperature of about 185�F (85C) but do not cause fire hazard. Possible causes for trays becoming deformed may be due to the temperature control part is out of tolerance or the relay that controls the heater circuit may be defective.

We then switched to pampers baby dry and cruisers(more premium of the pampers brand). After a week or so of using the diapers my son developed what we thought was usual diaper rash, but NOTHING cleared it up!

It is a red, raised, and in some spots blistery. We have had it checked by the Dr. to rule out any other possible causes (yeast, etc) We have also used other brands of diapers ([REDACTED] brand...) without causing of this rash. I have three other children, all of which we used pampers, and all without issue. I prefer pampers over other brands. Hopefully Pampers will do something about his issue, or we will be forced to switch brands. Not sure what they changed, but it is definitely a pampers issue!

During the time in which I was using Pampers swaddlers, I would notice reddened areas around the contact areas where the diaper would touch (mostly around the front area). I do not let my child really saturate her diaper; however, I put it off as somewhat of a contact dermatitis from her urine. About 3 weeks ago, when we ran out of the Pamper we switched to an off brand to save money. WITHIN THE FIRST DAY OF CHANGING TO THESE DIAPERS, MY BABIES RED AREA AROUND HER GENITALS DISAPPEARED.

Engine model is a Tecumseh LV195XA Serial# 363089E. Tecumseh was bought out by the company Certified Parts. New Fuel Tank part number is 37947. I purchased this mower new and within a few years, the gas tank developed a leak at the seam on the the middle back of the tank. The tank is attached directly to the back of the engine. I attribute this problem to a faulty gas tank design. The leaking gas can cause fumes to build up in a homeowners garage which can lead to an explosion, or can lead to a fire while in operation.

Upon inspection, I noticed that the plastic fuel tank is cracked. This creates a potential for fire and injury. The fuel tank is fused/molded to the plastic shroud that covers the top of the machine. A crack developed where the tank & shroud meet. This appears to be a common probelm, as Toro recognized this hazard and issued a recall (release #06-224, 8/3/2006). However, the recall only appled to their 20" & 24" snowthrowers. The model I have is a 16" size, but the fuel tank/shroud design is very similar to the recalled models.

There has been a previous recall on similar units manufactured prior to the unit in question. The previous release number in #00-115. Homeowner smelled smoke in residence due to overheated motor on treadmill. Upon inspection of the smoke alarm in the same room as the treadmill we discovered a small hole melted in the back of the alarm and there is a brown halo around the small hole. Homeowner was advised not to reinstall the alarm but to purchase a new alarm. We also advised them to check the other units in the home for a similar melting issue.

It is packaged in a canister, similar to a 1gallon paint can but smaller. Directions call for heating over a camp stove on High for 1 hour, stirring it after 15 minutes. The canister lid was removed, and I _loosely_ placed a sheet of tinfoil on top since it was windy. I skipped the step of applying tinfoil on grate to prevent any spills. The canister was then placed on the campstove. The flame was initially set to High as the instructions indicated. After a moment, I adjusted it to Medium/Low to save fuel, then approximately 3 minutes later the canister burst open from the bottom, and it sprayed hot, liquified rubber over my garage door (see attached photos). The canister was stored in an unheated garage, and the ambient temperature was 48 degrees. Power of the campstove is advertised as 10,000 BTU/hr at maximum setting. I noticed very shortly after the explosion, that the top portion of the rubber was still solid in the canister. No warnings are given, in the instructions or packaging, about the potential for this product to burst and expel hot, liquified rubber. Nor are there specifications regarding minimum operating temperatures or campstove limitations.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Fridley<br><b>Product</b>: Driveway Crack Sealer<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(1/8/2013) U-SEAL USA (USEAL INC) : We feel that the aluminum foil that was put on top of the can, where the tar needed to be stirred, did not allow the gases/vapors to escape, which possibly created the incident. The product was unattended while heating; the consumer was located in a car, backing away from an asphalt crack he was going to repair. The consumer sent a Certified mail complaint with a demand letter of $2,300 to U-Seal USA, with no phone number available for contact. U-Seal USA sent an incident report form through FedEx to get more information from the consumer and also responded that we would like to speak to the contractor regarding the estimated $2,300 in damage. At this point, U-Seal USA has never received anything back regarding the incident. U-Seal USA takes accidents very seriously and have done vigorous testing regarding such incidents. With the vigorous testing that has been done, we have never seen this type of problem.<br><hr><b>Consumer Reply</b><br>(11/7/2011) The product is a hot liquified rubber crack filler for home use filling cracks in asphalt driveways. The product comes pre-filled in a can like a metal paint can and comes with a handle that clamps onto the can. You are to heat the filler on a camping cookstove or grille to melt it, and then stir before pouring in the cracks. I used a small camping gas burner that fit onto a 1 lb. propane bottle to heat it. The instructions said to heat it on medium heat, then begin stirring after 15 minutes. In following the instructions and doing that, the product did not melt as it was supposed to, it began to raise in the can but the top layer did not begin to melt. I began to get concerned and kept checking it, and I could see the bottom of the can beginning to swell. Expecting the top to melt, I left it on the heat longer. The filler continued to raise in the can with the top not melting, so I sensed something was really wrong. I then grabbed the handle of the container with my right hand that had a glove on, raised it off the heat and turned off the camp burner with my left hand. At that point the bottom of the can exploded down, spraying the hot crack filler down onto my left hand and up onto my face. I received 1st and 2nd degree burns on both my face and hand, requiring going to the hospital emergency room to remove the tar and treat the burns. I have needed recurring visits to a burn center to continue to treat the burns. The instructions did not have any warning about the possibility that the can could could blow out spraying hot filler, or what to do when the filler did not melt properly.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Burnsville<br><b>Product</b>: Hot Rubberized Crack filler for asphalt driveways<br><b>Status</b>: Injury, Emergency Department Treatment Received<br></div><h3 class="acc-name two">UTC Fire & Security</h3><div><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(6/15/2014) When I hooked up my new carbon monoxide detector, it didn't work.

There is little resistance to turn the knob like on other gas grills or stoves. I store my grill near an air intake vent for my furnace room, so when the gas is accidentally turned on, the gas leaks into my basement near the furnace creating a potentially dangerous situation. I try to remember to turn the gas off on the grill after each grilling session, but on three occasions have forgotten and smelled gas in my basement soon thereafter. I'm afraid one of these times the gas will ignite. I have seen other reports online about this and weber customer service just recommends remembering to turn the gas off at the source each time.

The oven was NOT turned on and NEITHER was the stove top, it had not been on since the previous evening. I was wearing jeans so other than my knees stinging from the impact, I did not suffer any injuries. I was very startled and it took my husband and I repeated sweepings, vacuumings and washings to get all the tiny shards of glass off the floor. Although I was lucky not to be injured, the potential for serious injury was enormous. If I had been bending down to look through the glass, the explosion would have caught me in the face and throat. Worse, yet, if one of my 4 small grandchildren had been in the kitchen, the explosion could have very well been deadly to them. Since it was Sunday, the Maytag Customer Service Department was not open so I found a site online where I completed two different reports to Maytag. The next day, February 11th., a Maytag representative called me regarding my reports and I went through the details with her. The representative expressed her sympathy for my experience but said there was nothing else that Maytag could offer me regarding the matter. I asked to speak to someone of a higher authority so she said that she would transfer me to a supervisor. After several minutes of being put on hold and the representative coming back online to tell me repeatedly that she was having difficulty transferring me to a supervisor, she offered to transfer me to their Safety Division and I asked that she do so. Well, that was an exercise in futility and sarcasm. I again went through every detail of the exploding oven door event. The safety rep reminded me that my range was over 7 years old and no longer had a warranty. What the rep offered me was a part replacement, however, I would have to pay for their designated, authorized repair man's trip fee, first for his initial visit to assess the damage, and for his second visit to replace the part as well as the cost of labor. When I told him that his offer was not acceptable, the rep repeatedly told me, "Hey, I thought I was being helpful!" I then asked him if he would listen to what I had to say, and I said that my main concern was that the exploding oven door was a major safety concern and had the potential of seriously injuring or killing someone. He interrupted me and said, "But No One did get hurt!" I further said that I wanted to know why this had happened, what would cause an oven door to explode, especially when the stove and oven were cooled and had not been used for a day (not that it should have ever happened even if they were on,) the rep did not even respond to this question. I also told him that we no longer felt it was safe to use the range and we expected Maytag to reimburse us for the purchase of a new range. I told him that this was an issue of quality and safety, not an issue of the stove's age; this should never have happened no matter how old the stove, and 7 years is certainly not "old." I also told the rep that I was not asking be to reimbursed for any medical expenses, nor was I asking for punitive damages, I wanted only to be reimbursed for the cost of new range. I asked if there was someone else I could appeal my request to and he said "No." The rep then told me he would offer me this "one time only, good for only 30 days, 20% coupon" to use towards the purchase of another one of their ranges. I told him this was not acceptable and he again reminded me of how helpful he thought he was being to me. I concluded the telephone call.

I then opened and shut dishwasher, hit cancel to see if it would turn off and that didn't work. My husband then went and turned the circuit breaker on and off and half an hour later it still was on and burning HOT. He then went and shut the circuit breaker all together.

The glass on the front of the door fell out as I opened the oven. It is held in place mostly by a spongy, double stick tape that failed on the range side. I put it back in, tightened all the screws, and it fell out again. I doesn't stay in without the tape. I see this as a design flaw, using tape that fails under high temperature in a stove! I wasn't injured, and the glass didn't break, but I can see where people could be injured. The glass probably wouldn't break, since it's tempered and it only falls a little way.

I would never had noticed it until I smelled an electrical smoldering smell as I was using just the exhaust fan of the unit so it drowned out the buzzing until I turned the fan off. I had to open and close door several times and kept pushing the off switch until it stopped buzzing. I then unplugged power cord and I am still watching it to make sure I don't have a fire tonight. About three years ago, I found Glass Turn Table broken & replaced it at hefty cost but I did not know how the break occurred but I now believe this may have stuck on once before and now I have 2 broken glass turn tables in 3 years.

[REDACTED] UPDATE: On February 28, 2012 A&E Factory Service came to my home and only spent about 10-15 minutes looking at my Maytag Microwave and mostly writing notes to his computer. In this time, the Technician did not even remove a cover to the main components and condemned the Circuit Board and Broken Microwave Turntable Glass Dish. He said that Maytag would pay the labor but I would have to pay $221.32 for the parts required to fix the Microwave. I do not trust this Microwave, as I believe that a dangerous fire could result even if they fixed the current problem I wanted them to replace the complete unit or at least cover all the charges including the parts but the Technician said that they wouldn't.

The relay that controls the AC power to the oven heating element short circuited permanently in the "ON" position providing power to the heating element that could not be turned off using the controls on the range. The contacts in the oven relay welded together in the ON position. The only way to stop the oven from getting hotter and hotter is to unplug the range or turn off the AC circuit breaker. Fortunately I was home at the time and discovered the overheating oven. Had I not been home, had not noticed the oven overheating, or if I had used the timer to activate the oven the results could have been disasterous. Being an engineer by trade I examined the condition and discovered that a NAIS/Panasonic/Aeromat relay model JW2H-T-F-DC24V-Y8-H had malfunctioned, the contacts welded together permanently in the ON position, supplied uncontrolled power to the oven heating element. The relay is located in the oven clock electronics assembly. The relay directly controls the application of 240 VAC to the oven heating element. Further examination of the oven electrical schematic reveals there is no overtemp fuse or other device to prevent thermal runaway once the relay fails.

I called Geek Squad as we bought the extended warranty and they came out today/1/12/12, after taking off the front door,they removed the drum and the kick-plate to find the bottom of the dryer filled with burnt lint. There had been a fire under the dryer, even the sticker on the bottom of the dryer was burned, the fire was contained to the bottom of the dryer. They said the lint screen gets most but not all lint, the dryer is only 5 years old. The lint will build up again & I am concerned this dryer is a fire hazard. I asked the Geek Squad if I could somewhow vacuum the lint from that area and they indicated I could not reach the area without taking off the door and other parts. I am very afraid the dryer could start on fire again and am upset the fire occurred at night when we were all asleep in the house.

The consumer's range is not a smooth top model. The consumer's range is operated with dials at the range and the the oven is digital. The product has 2 aluminum gas lines behind the stove. One goes to the range and one to the oven. When the stove was assembled the galvanized steel over the gas line was touching the gas lines. The consumer theorizes when you fuse two metals the weaker metal (the galvanized one) would corrode faster. In the consumer's case, both gas lines are leaking gas since the faulty metal has caused a corrosion. The consumer has never experienced any issues with the range prior. The consumer called the firm today and was informed that they have had no complaints of such incidents and agreed to send a technician at the expense of the consumer depending on the findings of the technician. The consumer has yet to call the seller of the product. The consumer stated by outward appearances the product shows no signs of damage.

I was making dinner and went to quickly heat something up in the microwave. Immediately I noticed that the microwave was louder and then it made a weird electrical zap kind of noise. I opened the door wondering if there was something metal in the microwave, there wasn't. I proceeded to remove the packaging that the food was on and put it on a paper plate and tried to reheat it again. This time, the microwave appeared fine (no loud noise or zap). The problem, however, is that the food didn't heat up. I tried a few more times with no result. The next day, my husband tried to reheat something in a microwave-safe dish and had the same loud noise and zap. We decided to unplug the microwave and call Whirlpool. The Whirlpool rep stated they were not able to troubleshoot microwaves over the phone. The only thing suggested was to switch off and on the breaker. I was given names to service repair companies, which I called. According to the repairman, it appears that the issue is related to an open High Voltage circuit within the microwave (zap noise) and the magnetron. They are coming out to repair the microwave at a cost of approximately $200. While obviously frustrated by purchasing such an expensive appliance only to have major problems less than 2 years later, I was mortified to see similar issues posted by consumers like myself across the web. This issue appears to be more than an occasional glitch and Whirlpool should acknowledge the issue and repair these microwaves! I called Whirlpool back after learning more. Whirlpool said that there were no product recalls on this item. The third customer service rep I spoke with stated something to the effect that there were some issues with the model # I owned, but wouldn't explain further other than to say that my particular issue was not covered. I acknowledged Whirlpool's response that consumers post things on websites that they cannot control nor take action on without talking to the consumer. According to many of the posts, however, people are contacting Whirlpool and are getting nowhere, so I then asked the customer service rep if she could search specific model numbers and see what issues consumers have been calling about to verify if there is a pattern. She said that a search like that is possible. When I asked if she would do such a search, she said that that is not part of her job, however, she would document my suggestion. I asked her, if in her opinion, anyone would pursue this request and she said that it is logged in my record. Asking her again, she said that would send the request to her supervisor. I am not confident, however, that anyone within Whirlpool will look into this. I was asked by Whirlpool what I wanted out of my call to them. I stated that the bottom line was that it appeared the trouble I have with my microwave is echoed across the web by other consumers and doesn't seem to be an isolated problem. Because the rep didn't have any specific knowledge of the incidents, I wanted them to do their own measurable searches to verify or dispute the information (as stated above). Based on their findings, than pursue to rectify the situation, and if they found a pattern of similar issues, for them to publicly acknowledge the issue and repair the microwaves. I paid a large sum of money for a microwave/convection oven purchased less than 2 years ago that is no longer working properly and is potentially a hazard to myself and other consumers and feel that Whirlpool has a responsibility to find out if that is true or not. For our family, we've learned an expensive lesson, and won't be buying from Whirlpool again unless they get their act together and start caring about the quality of products they produce and the consumers that purchase them.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Prior Lake<br><b>Product</b>: Whirlpool Gold Microwave / Convection Oven - Stainless Steel - Over the Stove/Oven<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><hr><h4>Consumer Complaint</h4>(4/15/2011) The consumer says she was sitting next to unit when black smoke and sparks started coming out of unit.

There was smoke on the panel on the outside of the top of the stove. My son called Maytag and after waiting for over an hour for a response on the phone, he was eventually told that this make and model was not a part of a previous recall.

We bought a Pottery Barn "Riviera" outdoor sectional last summer. It was delivered and assembled on [REDACTED]. We used the sectional and tempered-glass tabletop without incident last summer and fall. However, because the weather has been so wet and lousy this summer in Minnesota, we just got around to putting out the glass tabletop this past Sunday night 7/13/14. So, around 5:00pm my wife and I brought the glass tabletop out of our house, used [REDACTED] on both sides to clean it, and placed it on the coffee table of our sectional set. (The glass was NOT cracked or damaged in anyway at that time.) However, WITHIN AN HOUR, we looked out our window see what seemed like more than a thousand glass shards and pieces all over our patio. The glass exploded in all directions. We found glass more than 25 feet away in your yard, garden and pool area. Luckily, no one was injured! While temperature fluctuations (between indoor and outdoors) could potentially be an explanation for this exploding glass occurrence, that possibility never would have occurred to us given that this furniture is made for OUTDOOR USAGE where temperatures fluctuate quite regularly. Plus, this potential danger of exploding glass is NOT MENTIONED ANYWHERE in the product information that accompanied our purchase from Pottery Barn. (For the record, our indoor temperature was 74 degrees and the outdoor temperature was about 75 degrees when we placed the glass tabletop on the sectional coffee table.) We asked Pottery Barn for a quick remedy to this situation as we did not spend several thousand dollars on this Riviera sectional set to have to deal with this sort of mess, as well as the potential danger of exploding glass.

Then the Pyrex container was placed in the microwave with the ears of corn for 1 minute and then again for 1 minute 30 seconds to warm the corn. The corn was immediately removed. The Pyrex container then sat on the counter at room temp (73 degrees F) for 45 minutes. We were in our basement and heard what sounded like a crash. Nothing had fallen and we found glass shattered on the counter and all over the floor below. We presumed that the dish had exploded from changing temperatures.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Rochester<br><b>Product</b>: Pyrex glass container. Rectangle shape.

A nice 9x13 and 8x8 piece, each with a cover and carrying case. I've had old pyrex pieces for years but was attracted to the accessories for ease of transporting dishes. I used the 9x13 to bake scalloped corn for Thanksgiving. Given the introduction of a lid and the carrying case, I read and followed the directions carefully. I took the casserole out of the 325 degree oven and immediately (directions stated to do so within 2 min.) put the cover on and put it in the insulated carrying case. The casserole then was put in the trunk of my car, on a 50 degree day, sat there for the 90 min. drive to my brothers. I took it out of the car, carried it into the house. My sister in law took it out of the insulated carrier, and set it on the table. About 5 min. later, I heard a strange noise. Just as I looked to see where the noise came from, the casserole EXPLODED in front of my eyes. It shattered thousands of pieces of glass all over the table and floor. Not only was the food made inedible, my niece and my sister in law were cut by the glass. I brought the remaining pieces back to Costco and got a refund. I went out and bought a [REDACTED] pan to replace it because I am spooked by the experience and not feeling safe to buy another new pyrex product. That is unfortunate for me as I loved the accessories. I know Pyrex type glass casseroles have limitations and need to be properly cared for, but for 35 years, I have had, and still have, old pyrex casseroles with which I've never had a problem. There must be something new in your product and, quite frankly, I am now scared to buy anything new that is Pyrex.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Minneapolis<br><b>Product</b>: 9x13 casserole<br><b>Status</b>: Injury, First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(1/14/2013) World Kitchen, LLC: At World Kitchen the safety of consumers is our highest priority.

Today my glass dish exploded while cooking in the stove at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The glassware was at room temperature when I placed it in the oven with three stuffed peppers for baking. I had coated the bottom of the glass with non-stick spray before placing the peppers on it. I was approaching the oven to take my dinner out when I heard a what sounded like a gunshot then the sound of shattered glass falling. I feel this should not happen especially since I was properly handling the glassware.<br><br><b>Location</b>: Minneapolis<br><b>Product</b>: Pyrex 13)<br><b>Status</b>: Incident, No Injury<br><br><h4>Company Reply</h4>(6/27/2012) World Kitchen, LLC: At World Kitchen the safety of consumers is our highest priority.

It took him two hours to vacuum all pieces up. Caller considers this to be a serious safety issue if someone were not wearing glasses or if a child had been nearby. He said that the shock of the incident makes it difficult to say whether the glass hit his glasses or not but Tiny pieces of glass did hit his chest and his arms. Caller states that if the pie dish had broken he finds this very acceptable but not an explosion sending glass throughout the air. Caller's wife heard sound in another room and describes it as the sound of an explosion.
