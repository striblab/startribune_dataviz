 Minnesota’s hospitals have publicly reported adverse events since 2005. There are now 32 categories, including medication errors, foreign objects left in a body during surgery, serious pressure ulcers, and operating on the wrong body part. Some categories have changed over the years -- for example, before 2010 hospitals reported only patient falls that led to death, but now they also report those that cause serious injuries.
