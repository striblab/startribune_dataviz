	<li>Travels by transit "occassionally," primarily on the Green Line. Estimated it was about 20 times a year.</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Haigh said she primarily rides the Green Line light rail, which travels between her offices at Habitat for Humanity and the Met Council. 
<br /><br />
"I do not take transit as much as I would like due to a demanding schedule from my dual roles as part-time chair of the Council and my other full-time job," Haigh wrote in an e-mail.
<br /><br />
"I tour new transit way corridors in development many times a year." Haigh said information that the Met Council and Metro Transit staff receive from passengers is "important, if not more important" to improving the system than their own perceptions. 
<br /><br />
"The nature of my two jobs is that I am all over the metro area for meetings and am often unable to include the additional time needed for transit in my schedule, which limits my usage," Haigh said. "I believe my transit ridership is helpful to overseeing the system, but so too are the conversations I regularly have with every day users."</li>

	<li>Tries to take transit "at least twice a month."</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Rodriguez commutes to St. Paul twice a week, but Met Council meetings frequently run too long for her to catch the last bus back to Maple Grove at 6:36. She tries to take transit on the two Mondays each month when the council does not have committee meetings, and has occasionally not swiped her pass. 
<br /><br />
"When I travel to meetings in my district (District 1-northwest Hennepin County) there aren’t options for community to community transit," Rodriguez wrote in an e-mail. "I would also love to take transit into the city more on the weekends but there isn’t service from Maple Grove or Plymouth on the weekends." 
<br /><br />
When she does ride, her primary routes are the 781, 781A and the Green Line light rail. Rodriguez said she enjoys using transit and wishes she had more choices because it would allow her to work while commuting. 
<br /><br />
"One of the reasons I applied for my position on [Met Council] was to continue to build a transit system to give everyone more choices to move around the region," Rodriguez said.</li>

	<li>Schreiber said she does not use her employee pass when she does ride transit, which she does rarely.
<br /><br />
"As I am retired, my major commutes include driving to St. Paul for the bulk of my Metropolitan Council meetings," Schreiber wrote in an e-mail. "My home is not located in a full daily bus service area, so the the use of bus transit would be difficult with transfers and not time saving." 
<br /><br />
Schreiber said she has long been a strong transit advocate in the public arena.

	<li class="header"><b>Transit Usage</b></li>
	<li>Estimated she has used transit "at least 30 times" in last year.</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Munt said she makes an effort to test the system, since she believes it is important for decision makers to be familiar with it. She shows bus drivers her pass, rather than swiping it. But, she added, "I am not somebody who uses transit for my daily commute, simply because my job requires me to drive.” 
<br /><br />
As public affairs director for AFSCME, she said she is frequently bouncing to different suburban locations throughout the day. Her transit trips include taking the No. 16 and Green Line between Minneapolis and St. Paul for work, as well as traveling from the Hopkins Park-and-Ride to Uptown for leisure. She also has ridden in north Minneapolis to examine the condition of the route and its shelters. She said she learns a lot from her constituents.
<br /><br />
 "I know that my colleagues, even those who may not be using transit themselves, are listening to and being responsive to constituents who are frustrated that there could be more and better transit service," Munt said.</li>

	<li class="header"><b>Transit Usage</b></li>
	<li>Uses transit once or twice a month</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Elkins said he is unable to commute by transit because he is traveling from Bloomington to Golden Valley and the transfer in Minneapolis adds a significant delay. 
<br /><br />
“The challenge is that it’s not quite a large enough job concentration [near my home] to be able to support the kind of focused transit service that you have in the downtowns," Elkins said. He was a regular bus commuter on the No. 589 when he worked downtown several years ago, however. 
<br /><br />
"Anytime where my day job has been downtown, I’ve been a regular bus rider," Elkins said.
<br /><br />
 He now primarily uses the system for "pleasure excursions" like going to a Twins game or eating near University Avenue. That could involve taking the Blue line from the Mall of America into downtown or hopping on the Green Line. Elkins described himself as a "transit geek" when he travels, taking time to ride other systems and observe transit-oriented development.</li>

<br /><br />
"I have used it occasionally to the airport and MOA," Brimeyer wrote in an e-mail, adding that he sometimes takes the Green Line from Target Field Station to St. Paul. He does not swipe the pass at the light rail station, but produces if it requested. 
<br /><br />
"The last question is a bit insulting," Brimeyer said of the Star Tribune's inquiry about whether his oversight of Metro Transit is impacted by his usage of the system.</li>

	<ul>
	<li class="header"><b>Transit Usage</b></li>
	<li>Rides transit "mostly on the weekend to go downtown or to an event"</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Cunningham recently started commuting to downtown Minneapolis from his South Minneapolis home, after leaving a job of seven years in St. Paul. He primarily drives in, but rides his bike when possible. 
<br /><br />
“I certainly take the bus downtown when I go to the Twins game, or something like that," said Cunningham, who is married to mayor Betsy Hodges. "But I can’t take it for work because I have to go to a lot of meetings. And I have meetings all day during the day. Some are in St. Paul, some are in Minneapolis, they’re not spread across in a way that I would like." 
<br /><br />
He generally pays cash when he does take transit. Cunningham noted that he grew up using the system in Minneapolis and has extensive knowledge of its layout. 
<br /><br />
"We didn’t have any money," Cunningham said. "What were you going to do?" 
<br /><br />
He attempted to take the train from downtown Minneapolis to teach an evening class at the University of Minnesota, but it proved impractical.
<br /><br />
 "The class ends at 9," Cunningham said. "I didn’t get home until 11. I was like, ‘I’m not doing that again.’" 
<br /><br />
Cunningham said Met Council members are appointed for their accomplishments and ability to analyze issues. He thinks they should test the transit system, however. 
<br /><br />
"I have done some of that," Cunningham said. "And every time I ride it I always have a great time. I haven’t had a bad experience."</li>

	<li>Rides transit at least once a week, using both bus and light rail.</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Duininck said he intentionally bought his home near transit because he was a student at the University of Minnesota at the time. He is also a frequent cyclist for three seasons of the year. 
<br /><br />
"I have always enjoyed the freedom to move around without a car," Duininck wrote in an e-mail. 
<br /><br />
"I have experienced a noticeable increase in my use since the Green Line opened as I work at Snelling and University."
<br /><br />
In addition to the Green and Blue light rail lines, Duininck frequents the Nos. 22, 21, 53, 84 and 16.
<br /><br />
"I've found that being a frequent rider certainly informs my ability as a policymaker," Duininck said. "I have experienced things firsthand whether that is waiting for a late bus, taking in the shelter and amenities around the region, and also talking with other transit users about their perspectives. I enjoy talking with others on the bus and train."</li>

	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Reynoso said his job prohibits him from taking transit very often, particularly from his home in Ham Lake. 
<br /><br />
"My job requires me to have a car at most times," Reynoso said. "I’m popping in from one meeting to another. And whether I’m at the Capitol or a meeting with somebody in Minneapolis, especially where I live it’s not very conducive for me to be able to use the transit system because of the need of my car." 
<br /><br />
He said he does occasionally ride to talk with passengers about the service. He did this recently with the new express bus that recently began traveling from Ham Lake to downtown Minneapolis. "I don’t rely on it to get me to and from work or to get me to specific places," Reynoso said. "I just used it to engage and talk to customers. And find out what they like, what they believe is working, what isn’t working. I think that's extremely important."</li>

"The only reason that I’m not using it is because my real job -- my full time job -- doesn’t allow me the convenience," Melander said, noting that he must frequently drive around the state for work. Those drives might take him to Medina, International Falls or Hallock -- or even outside the state. The four or five times a year he has the opportunity take the bus, he said, it has worked well. 
<br /><br />

	<li class="header"><b>Transit Usage</b></li>

	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Kramer, whose district includes downtown St. Paul, said he recalls using transit three or four times since he was appointed -- to return home from his confirmation hearing and two Met Council meetings. Because he is caring for a relative at his East Side home, Kramer only travels to his office once or twice a week. His printing shop is on the edge of the East Side. 
<br /><br />
"When I do go to work it usually involves bringing in blank paper, printing on it and delivering it to a client," Kramer said, noting that lugging large boxes is not conducive to taking the bus. Kramer said the Metropolitan Council does not supervise transit on a day-to-day basis. He observed that they do not vote on route changes, though they are informed about them.

	<li>Has taken transit about 77 times in the last year.</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Commers appears to lead the pack in transit use among his colleagues, claiming about 77 rides in the last year. He lives in St. Paul and has an office near Raymond and University Avenues. 
<br /><br />
"I’ve been a transit rider for many years now," Commers said. Even 77 rides isn't daily use of the system, he noted. But when he knows he will be in the office for much of the day, he takes the bus or rides his bike. 
<br /><br />
"There are plenty of days where my work responsibilities or Met Council responsibilities require that I am travelling in ways that make it more difficult to use transit," Commers said. "And I think that in itself is valuable learning [opportunity] as far as thinking about how the transit system is designed and then operated." 
<br /><br />
Commers said he primarily rides the No. 3, 87 and 16. 
<br /><br />
"It gives me I think a useful perspective to bring to the work that I do shaping policy, and the work that I do specifically on the transportation committee," Commers said. He added that it would be unfair to say his colleagues who ride less frequently are less able to make transit-related decisions.</li>

	<li class="header"><b>Transit Usage</b></li>
	<li>Takes transit "a couple of times monthly," primarily light rail.</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Chavez said he works almost exclusively from his residence in Eagan. When he does take transit, it is to attend Met Council meetings. Chavez said he primarily uses the Blue and Green light rail lines. 
<br /><br />
"Due to the location of my residence office, I must drive either to MVTA's transit station at Pilot Knob & Yankee Doodle Rd, which merely provides express service between Eagan & the 2 central business districts during limited time windows which don't match my meeting schedules in the 2 central business districts," Chavez wrote in an e-mail. "Or I must drive to the Cedar Grove station to connect to the Mall of America, or I must drive to one of the stations on the Blue Line to travel into Minneapolis."</li>

	<ul>
	<li class="header"><b>Transit Usage</b></li>
	<li>Takes transit "more than once a month, and less than once a week."</li>
	<li class="header"><b>Explanation</b></li>
	<li>Wulff said she works from home, but takes transit if she is going to a meeting in Minneapolis. When she does ride, her primary routes are the Blue Line light rail and the Nos. 460, 467 and 476. 
<br /><br />
"I think it is important to use and be familiar with the system, to be able to see how it works from the customer's perspective - both from a service standpoint, and can it get you where you need to go," Wulff wrote in an e-mail. She said there is no particular pattern to her use.
<br /><br />
"I might take transit 3 days in a row, and then not for a month," Wulff said.</li>
