"Notes:"
"Because Hispanic ethnicity was not asked on the Decennial Census before"
"1980, Hispanics in 1960 and 1970 may have been classified as either White"
"or Of Color."
""
"Prior to 2000, the Decennial Census allowed individuals to select only one"
"race, with the result that some multiracial people may have been counted"
"only as White."
""
"In 2010 and later, the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates program"
"reclassified individuals in the ""some other race"" category into one of"
"the five standard race categories.  This change results in the number ""Of"
"Color"" being slightly smaller than it otherwise would have been."
