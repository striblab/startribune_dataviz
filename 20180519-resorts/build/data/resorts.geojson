    "Details":"Grand View Lodge offers many lodging options in four distinct areas, from lodge rooms to townhouses near the golf course. In high season, two-bedroom cabins with four queen beds on the main property go for $680 per night; a two-bedroom cabin at Colony Bay Inn, on Gull Lake three miles from the main property, run $390 per night ",
    "Review":"Set on the north shore of Gull Lake only a mile outside Nisswa � the kind of small Minnesota town that still has an A&W drive-in � Grand View did suit at least one of our vacation preferences, which is staying in historic lodges. How ironic, then, that we�ve never actually stayed in the 1919-dated lodge itself but have rented nearly every type of cabin, townhouse and fourplex unit the resort has to offer, usually based on whatever is being offered under the �Last Minute Vacancies� tab on their site .",

They also took down two cabins and replaced them with side by side cabins with A/C, larger sleeping accommodations, and kitchen/eating areas. But they kept the 'Tin Can,' a three bedroom mobile home which our high school- and college-age grandchildren have stamped as theirs because they can stay up until 2 a.m. (or later) and sleep until noon.  . . . The first summer we were there, we celebrated the marriage of one of our five daughters. I brought used bridesmail dresses with me and a wedding dress.

One year in particular stands out, it was the first year I took my son.  We went for a weekend at the end of May, and he was 8 years old.  I wanted to get him to appreciate ,and hopefully love, the outdoors and nature. We had a sunny weekend . . . We went horseback riding, fed ducks, threw rocks, canoed, took a pontoon ride and hike to Bridal Falls, and joined naturalist guided activities over the 3 day weekend.  I even hired a half-day fishing guide that provided a fantastic adventure, complete with poles and bait for four hours on the lakes.  . . .  We saw beavers and loons on the lake while fishing, and the day was 70 degrees and full of sun.  On the morning of our Sunday departure I told my son that we would head down to breakfast and start our trip home. All of a sudden, tears welled up in his eyes and he started to cry. He said, 'I don't want to go home.",

Its familiarity draws us back each year.Who wouldn't want to repeat waking to the sound of Lake Superior's waves on a magnificent beach? You can start your day right outside the lodge with the hike up the Brule River to the mysterious Devil's Kettle where half the river is swallowed by a large opening in the rock, rumored to have no bottom. . . . The beauty of the lodge and the majesty of the lake combine to refresh and invigorate.  The combination of exerting yourselves on the trails along Superior only to return to a place of simple luxuries keeps us coming back. Dinner in the famous dining room is always a treat, with old favorites and a new item or two on the menu each year.",

The heart of the resort is a beautiful 100-year-old log building with pool tables, just enough arcade games and an impressive stone fireplace for those rare chilly mornings.  There is also a log sauna building.  . . . Every day at a certain time, an old school bell rings and kids run from all over the resort to take part in that day's special activity . . .

    "Review":"Our family has been multi-generational vacationing at Two Inlets Resort near Park Rapids for the last eight years. The resort has a back-to-basics feel that helps us to unplug from a busy life . . . . One of our favorite memories is when we accidentally caught a turtle instead of an intended fish. My niece named it Mr. Incredible, and we donated him to the resort's turtle pond and the kids visited him every day of our vacation.",

The rocks and the constant rushing water are refreshing and gorgeous. . . . The swimming pool and the top of the dam were Mom's favorite spots. . . . Hiking, swimming, rock climbing, dam walking, fishing, paddle boating, pontoon rides with picnics on the bay. A walking trip to the DNR tower was incredible. . . . For my Dad, well, we hardly saw him during the day. He went out fishing early mornings, then came home for lunch, napped and went right back out again in the afternoon.",

You can also rent boating items as well as the resort pontoon, and fishing boats.\n \n They have miniature horses on the property that they get hooked up to a trailer and offer pony rides for the vacationers. \n \n There is a bait shop on site and a place to clean the fish that have been caught that day.\n \n They also have organized children events and crafts, such as hat making, tubing and the \"human launch\"!\n \n There is also a weekly night of a bonfire with s'more making while you can also just relax around a fire on a nice evening in the country.",
    "Review":"My family and I have been going to this resort yearly for at least the last 5yrs and the owners have been so welcoming and willing to assist with anything to make our stay the best we've had. It started with just my immediate family going and now has become an extended family event for the last couple of years. Whether you want beach time or out in the water, (the inflatable toys are so much fun) or even just relaxing in the cabin, this is place to go. I look forward to this vacation away every year! :)\n \n They do not allow pets at this resort, but they are very helpful in recommending boarding facilities in the area that are trustworthy. Just give them a call. I work in veterinary medicine and have pretty high standards as to where i board my dog... there is a really nice place about 20-30min from the resort that I have had my dog stay at and have been very pleased.",

There's a lodge with coffee and rolls and a few to-go dinning options (such as pizza and ice cream treats), board games for all ages which you can take to your cabin or play in the lodge for free, each of the cabins has a TV (some of them very large and new), and laundry. There's a wonderful beach and lots of water activities. During the summer season they provide morning pontoon rides and give boat rides with tubing, skiing, and/or wake boarding. The best attraction for kids is always the new water toys. There's a water trampoline, a very large slide and jumping toy, and of course, the blob that launches kids into the water (always a hit!). There's also a sand volleyball court, a playground, a fire pit, shelter, and lots of open green space. Oh, and the animals! There's a miniature donkey and three mini ponies. No lie! They even give pony rides to the kids! It's amazing.\n \n The new buildings have even more amenities such as a fireplace and full sized kitchens. They think of everything!",
    "Review":"My family and I go to East Silent Resort every year. It started with just my immediate family, but has grown to include grandparents, aunts and uncles, and all the cousins. We love it! The resort-goers in my family range in age from 1 to 88, and everyone has a good time. There is something for everyone here!\n \n You really can't beat all the personal touches and the family feel of the resort. The owners treat you like family and are so attentive to the needs of the guests. They provide all of these personal touches like the boat rides, kid's activities, bonfires, and pony rides. You really can't get that anywhere else. I highly recommend ESR.",
