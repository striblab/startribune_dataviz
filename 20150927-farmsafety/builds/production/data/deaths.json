One of the bales landed on Amundson, who was removing the straps securing the bales from the truck at the time. Skov's son, Logan, believes his dad jumped out of the tractor and tried to help Amundson, which is when another bale fell on him. Both men died of fractured skulls and other injuries. Logan Skov said the mistake the two men made that day was allowing Amundson to collect the straps while unloading, instead of waiting to do that when all of the bales were off -- a procedure Logan now insists on when he unloads bales. \"You can replace a $30 strap, but how do you replace a family member?\" he said.","latitude":46.62996,"longitude":-95.088914,"obituary":"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=67744062"},{"record_no":116,"death_year":2009,"death_county":"Olmsted","victim_name":"Stahl, Dale Harry","victim_age":67,"victim_age_group":"65 and older","resident_city":"Elgin","injury_city":"Haverhill Township","date_of_death":"2009-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","cause_of_death":"blunt force trauma","death_icon":"tractor","rank":1,"color":"#b96610","incident_description":"Three people were killed when their automobile ran into a tractor driven by farmer Bradley Herman, who was using the highway to get from one field to another to do some plowing.
