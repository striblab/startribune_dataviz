<p class="Text_Body">Crime across Minnesota dipped in 2016, hitting its lowest statewide rate in 50 years.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">The numbers, released by state police Thursday, show that a long trend of diminishing crime rates is continuing in Minnesota &mdash; even in urban areas &mdash; despite high-profile incidents of violence that have fueled concerns that crime could be on the rise.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Factoring in the rate of 10 serious types of crime &mdash; known collectively as &ldquo;index crime&rdquo; &mdash; the state saw a roughly 4 percent decline from 2015, according to the data, which is collected by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and reported to the FBI annually.</p>

<p class="Text_Body">Index crimes include violent crimes such as homicide, robbery and sexual assault, along with common property crimes, such as theft and burglary.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Violent crime alone remained static statewide compared with 2015, increasing less than 1 percent, the data showed.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">In total, 130,941 incidents were reported in 2016, or 2,372 per every 100,000 residents, about the same rate as in 1966.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Statewide, the number of murders dropped from 130 in 2015 to 100 last year &mdash; about a 23 percent decline. Robbery also decreased slightly, while rape and major assaults increased by less than 1 percent from 2015 &mdash; significantly lower than the rate of violent crime reported in the 1980s and &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">In Hennepin and Ramsey counties, the state&rsquo;s most populous, the crime rate has been declining for years.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">The index crime rate in Hennepin has dropped about 17 percent since 2009 and nearly 30 percent in Ramsey County over the same period. Neither county saw a significant overall change from 2015 to 2016.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">The numbers may buck public perception of rising crime rates and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t really reflect the rhetoric that we&rsquo;re hearing,&rdquo; said Ebony Ruhland, research director for the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Robina Institute of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Forty of the state&rsquo;s 100 murders in 2016 occurred in Hennepin County while 20 took place in Ramsey County.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Investigators cleared more than half of the Hennepin County murders, and 75 percent in Ramsey County, though the clearance rates could include the solving of murders from previous years.</p>

<p class="Text_ChapterHead"><span class="Text_Bold">Sex trafficking focus</span></p>
<p class="Text_Body">The report also reflects an increase in reports of sex trafficking, a new addition to data collection in Minnesota since 2014. In 2016, there were 235 reports of sex trafficking statewide, up from 119 in 2015.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">That increase, however, may be more telling of a concerted effort to police the crime than an actual rise in offenses, police officials said.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">St. Paul police Cmdr. Ken Sass attributed the increase to better cooperation between law enforcement agencies and a major philosophical shift by police to treating women and girls who are being trafficked as victims rather than as prostitutes.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re seeing more efficient and better investigations, which is really important, and especially with the Super Bowl coming,&rdquo; said Sass, who heads the department&rsquo;s narcotics and human trafficking units. &ldquo;Prostitution is the oldest profession. We look at the supply and demand side, which is why we do the John stings, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Sass said the department currently has three detectives assigned to its trafficking unit.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Minneapolis police Sgt. Grant Snyder echoed the sentiment, noting police have made a concerted effort to target these cases in recent years.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">&ldquo;When you look at this statistical increase, that&rsquo;s really exciting for us to see, because that tells us that people are really starting to work these cases,&rdquo; said Snyder, who has spoken nationally about human trafficking.</p>
