	<div class="chartTitle">Upgrading Minnesota’s Public Lands</div>
	<div class="chatter">The DNR has sold state-owned land for most of its history. Now it’s working to upgrade the state’s holdings by pruning scattered, low-priority parcels for money to buy better public land. Here’s a map of land sold over the last decade at the DNR’s public auctions and over the counter. Public sales made up about 60 percent of the DNR’s total land sales during the decade. Shows state land sold in public sales, spanning 2007-2017. Shaded from <span class="legendary gray1">less</span> to <span class="legendary gray5">more</span>.</div>
