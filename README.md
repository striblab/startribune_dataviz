# StribLab - Data-driven interactives, visuals, reporting and analysis for the Star Tribune.

2014-Present

These are dataviz projects and digital tools built for data-driven stories at the Star Tribune.

Public data is often included within the appropriately marked folders. Shapefiles and JSON maps are also usually available.

Each project folder houses a different web element. The index.html or index.php files should just load the visualization.

Most elements use Mike Bostock's [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/), [C3](https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/), [Mapbox JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.2.2/), [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) or some synthesis of those libraries.
